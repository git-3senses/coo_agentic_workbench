## 1. Template Overview & Usage

### 1.1 Template Types

**Base Template:** The official RMG OR template (Version Jun 2025) defines **47 base fields** across a Part A/B/C structure. This KB expands compound fields into discrete sub-fields for LLM auto-fill granularity, producing 65+ fields for Full NPA.

**IMPORTANT — 47 vs 65+ Field Count:**
- **47 fields** = official RMG OR base template (canonical count used across all system references)
- **65+ fields** = expanded granular fields for LLM auto-fill (compound fields split into sub-fields)
- **40+ fields** = NPA Lite (reduced set from 47 base)
- **75+ fields** = Bundling (47 base + bundling-specific sections)

**Three Primary Templates:**

| Template Type | When to Use | Complexity | Base Fields | Expanded Fields |
|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Full NPA** | NTG products, High-risk variations, Cross-border, >$50M notional | High | 47 | 65+ |
| **NPA Lite** | Low-risk variations, Existing products (new location), Dormant <3 years | Medium | ~35 | 40+ |
| **Bundling** | Multiple products combined (FX + IRS + Commodity) | High | 47 + bundling | 75+ |

## 5. Field Definitions & Validation Rules

### 5.1 Validation Types

**1. Format Validation**
- **Regex patterns** for structured fields (NPA ID, dates, emails)
- **Example:** NPA ID must match `^[A-Z]{2,4}[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{3}$`

**2. Range Validation**
- **Numeric ranges** (notional >$0, ROAE 0-100%)
- **Date ranges** (expiry date > trade date)

**3. Business Rule Validation**
- **Cross-field validation** (if cross-border → Finance + Ops + Tech required)
- **Threshold checks** (if notional >$50M → Finance VP required)

**4. Completeness Validation**
- **Required fields** (cannot submit NPA with missing required fields)
- **Document checklist** (warn if <90% complete)

**5. Sign-Off Validation**
- **Approval matrix** (ensure correct approvers assigned)
- **SLA tracking** (warn if approaching SLA breach)

---

### 5.2 Validation Error Messages

**Severity Levels:**
1. **BLOCKING ERROR (Red):** Cannot proceed (e.g., missing required field)
2. **WARNING (Yellow):** Can proceed with caution (e.g., ROAE <5%)
3. **INFO (Blue):** Informational only (e.g., "Similar NPA found: TSG1917")

**Example Error Messages:**
```
BLOCKING: Field "Counterparty Name" is required (cannot submit)
WARNING: ROAE (4.2%) below minimum threshold (5.0%) - Finance may reject
INFO: Similar NPA found (TSG1917, 94% match) - auto-fill available
```

### 5.3 Cross-Cutting Business Rule Gates (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**These rules are enforcement gates that OVERRIDE normal flow. They cannot be bypassed, waived, or skipped under any circumstances.**

| Rule | Gate | Enforcement | Consequence of Violation |
|------|------|-------------|------------------------|
| **R01** | Prohibited check BEFORE classification | Hard gate — Step 0 | Regulatory violation, sanctions breach |
| **R07** | Cross-border → 5 mandatory SOPs (Finance, Credit, MLR, Tech, Ops) | Auto-add to sign-off matrix, CANNOT be waived | Missing sign-off = incomplete governance |
| **R10** | Prohibited = HARD STOP, workflow termination | Block all stage transitions if prohibited | Criminal liability for sanctions |
| **R11** | NTG → ALWAYS Full NPA | DB constraint: `npa_type != NTG OR track = FULL_NPA` | NTG through Lite = missing mandatory reviews |
| **R16** | NTG requires PAC approval BEFORE NPA starts | Block NPA initiation if PAC ≠ Approved | Group governance violation, audit finding |
| **R22** | NTG from overseas → Head Office sign-offs | Auto-add Head Office parties when NTG + non-SG jurisdiction | Insufficient oversight of overseas NTG products |
| **R25-R26** | Maker → Checker → SOPs → COO final approval (sequential) | State machine: DRAFT → PENDING_CHECKER → PENDING_SIGN_OFFS → PENDING_FINAL_APPROVAL → APPROVED | Approval integrity |
| **R27** | 1-year validity (Evergreen: 3 years) | Auto-expire after validity period | Expired product traded = unauthorized activity |
| **R28** | One-time +6mo extension, unanimous SOP consent | Extension denied if ANY SOP disagrees | Over-extension without review |
| **R30-R32** | PIR mandatory (NTG: 6 months; GFM: ALL launched products) | Auto-schedule PIR on launch, send reminders | Missing PIR = audit finding |
| **R35** | Circuit breaker: 3 loop-backs → auto-escalate | Auto-create escalation at loop-back #3 | Infinite rework with no resolution |
| **R40** | Notional >$20M → ROAE sensitivity required | Block submission without Appendix III | Financial control gap |
| **R41** | Notional >$50M → Finance VP review | Auto-add Finance VP to sign-off matrix | Insufficient financial oversight |
| **R42** | Notional >$100M → CFO review | Auto-add CFO to sign-off matrix | Insufficient executive oversight |

## 6. Auto-Fill Logic & Data Sources

### Auto-Fill Data Sources:

**1. User Profile**
- **Fields:** Maker, Desk/BU, Location, NPA Champion
- **Source:** User authentication session

**2. Historical NPAs (KB Search)**
- **Fields:** Product specifications, risk analysis, pricing model, operational details
- **Source:** Semantic search over 1,784+ historical NPAs
- **Matching:** Product type + notional + location + counterparty type

**3. Classification Router Agent**
- **Fields:** Product Classification, Approval Track

**4. Approval Matrix (KB)**
- **Fields:** Required Sign-Off Parties, Approver Levels, Timeline SLA
- **Source:** KB_NPA_Approval_Matrix
- **Logic:** Tier determination (notional + cross-border + risk) → Approvers

**5. Prohibited List Checker Agent**

- **API:** Bloomberg API or manual upload

---

### Auto-Fill Workflow:

```
Step 0: PROHIBITED CHECK (Step 0, BEFORE everything) [R01]
  - Sanctions/regulatory/internal prohibited list screening
  - If FAIL → HARD STOP, no NPA created [R10]

Step 1: User starts NPA (NPA ID auto-generated)

Step 2: Product Ideation Agent interview (gather product details)

Step 3: Classification Router Agent
  - Stage 1: Classify product (NTG/Variation/Existing) [R02]
  - Stage 2: Determine approval track [R11: NTG → ALWAYS Full NPA]

Step 4: KB Search Agent (find similar historical NPA, 80%+ similarity)

Step 5: Template Auto-Fill Engine:
  - Copy 37/47 base fields from similar NPA
  - Adapt: Notional, counterparty, dates (user-specific)
  - Query CRM: Counterparty details, KYC, credit rating
  - Query MINV: Desk limits, VaR limits
  - Calculate: Aggregate notional, post-transaction limits, risk metrics
  - Check notional thresholds [R40/R41/R42] → auto-add escalation approvers

Step 6: Display to user:
  - GREEN: Auto-filled & verified (37 fields)
  - YELLOW: Auto-filled, verify (3 fields - user should double-check)
  - WHITE: Manual entry required (7 fields)

Step 7: User reviews, edits, submits
```

---

### Auto-Fill Confidence Scoring:

**High Confidence (GREEN):**
- Exact match from similar NPA (>90% similarity)
- Standard fields (desk, maker, booking system)
- Calculated fields (aggregate notional, post-transaction limits)

**Medium Confidence (YELLOW):**
- Adapted from similar NPA (80-90% similarity)
- Market data (may have changed since reference NPA)
- Risk assumptions (should validate)

**Low Confidence (WHITE):**
- No similar NPA found (<80% similarity)
- Counterparty-specific (must be entered manually)
- Future events (trade date, expiry date)

## 7. Template Selection Decision Tree

```
START: User initiates NPA

  ↓
Step 0: PROHIBITED CHECK [R01, R10]
  - Run Prohibited List Checker Agent
  - Screen counterparty + UBO against: OFAC, UN, EU, MAS, HKMA, internal policy
  - IF PROHIBITED → HARD STOP (no template, no NPA, no exceptions)

  ↓
Phase 0: Product Ideation Interview
  - Product details gathered (type, notional, counterparty, etc.)

  ↓
Classification Router Agent (Stage 1: Product Type) [R02]
  - New-to-Group (NTG)? → triggers: new product, role, channel, segment, exchange, geography [R03]
  - Variation? → triggers: bundling, cross-book, accounting, manual, ESG, fintech, 3rd-party [R04]
  - Existing? → sub-categories: new-to-location, dormant, expired [R05]

  ↓
Classification Router Agent (Stage 2: Approval Track)
  - Apply override rules (cross-border, notional, bundling, etc.)

  ↓
TEMPLATE SELECTION:

IF Product = NEW-TO-GROUP:
  → PAC approval MUST exist [R16]
  → Use FULL NPA TEMPLATE (47 base / 65+ expanded fields) [R11]
  → Auto-fill: 37/47 base fields (78%)
  → Required approvers: ALL 7 SOPs [R20]
  → If overseas: Head Office sign-offs [R22]
  → Timeline: 7-12 days
  → PIR: MANDATORY within 6 months [R30]

ELSE IF Product = VARIATION (High-Risk):
  → Use FULL NPA TEMPLATE (same as NTG)
  → High-risk = accounting change, cross-book, fintech
  → Timeline: 7-12 days

ELSE IF Product = VARIATION (Medium/Low-Risk):
  → Use NPA LITE TEMPLATE (40 fields)
  → Auto-fill: 34/40 fields (85%)
  → Required approvers: 2-3
  → Timeline: 4-5 days

ELSE IF Product = EXISTING:

  IF Active + on Evergreen list:
    → EVERGREEN (auto-approved if within limits) [R18]
    → Check Evergreen limits [R43]: $500M notional, deal count caps
    → IF limits PASS → Auto-approve (<1 hour), initiate NPA Lite reactivation in parallel
    → IF limits FAIL → Downgrade to NPA LITE TEMPLATE

  ELSE IF Active + NOT on Evergreen list:
    → NPA LITE - Reference Existing
    → Timeline: 4-5 days

  ELSE IF Dormant <3 years + fast-track criteria pass:
    → NPA LITE B3 - FAST-TRACK DORMANT (48 hours) [R14]
    → 5 criteria: live trade, not prohibited, PIR done, no variation, no booking change
    → If ALL pass → 48-hour no-objection, auto-approve
    → If ANY fail → Standard NPA Lite

  ELSE IF Dormant <3 years + variations detected:
    → NPA LITE (standard)
    → Timeline: 4-5 days

  ELSE IF Dormant ≥3 years:
    → ESCALATE to GFM COO [R05]
    → May require FULL NPA (COO decision)

  ELSE IF Expired + no variations:
    → NPA LITE - Reactivation [R29]
    → Timeline: 4-5 days

  ELSE IF Expired + variations:
    → FULL NPA (treated as effectively NTG) [R29]
    → Timeline: 7-12 days

ELSE IF Approval Track = "Bundling":
  → Check 8-Condition Gate (Appendix I) [R08, R17]
  → IF ALL 8 pass:
    → Use BUNDLING NPA TEMPLATE (75 fields)
    → Step 1: Bundling Arbitration Team review (2-3 days)
    → Step 2: Aggregate approvers (based on bundle tier + notional thresholds [R40-R42])
    → Timeline: 8-10 days
  → IF ANY condition FAILS:
    → Route to FULL NPA or NPA LITE (based on risk severity)

ELSE IF NPA Lite - Impending Deal (B1):
  → NPA LITE B1 template [R12]
  → 48-hour notice to all SOPs
  → ANY SOP objection → Fallback to standard NPA Lite
  → No objections after 48 hours → Auto-approved

ELSE IF NPA Lite - NLNOC (B2):
  → NPA LITE B2 template [R13]
  → GFM COO + RMG-MLR joint decision
  → SOPs provide no-objection concurrence
  → Timeline: 5-10 days

ELSE IF NPA Lite - Addendum (B4):
  → NPA LITE B4 (Addendum) template [R15]
  → LIVE NPA only (not expired)
  → Minor changes, same GFM ID, validity NOT extended
  → Timeline: <5 days

CROSS-CUTTING OVERRIDES (apply to ALL tracks):
  → If cross-border → Add 5 mandatory SOPs [R07]
  → If notional >$20M → ROAE sensitivity required [R40]
  → If notional >$50M → Finance VP added [R41]
  → If notional >$100M → CFO added [R42]
  → If loop-back count ≥ 3 → Circuit breaker → Escalate to COO [R35]

## 8. Real NPA Reference Examples

**Purpose:** Provide LLM agents with real precedents for classification, track selection, and complexity assessment

---

### 8.1 TSG1917: Exchange-Listed IR Options (No NPA Required)
- **Product:** US Exchange-listed Interest Rate Futures and Options
- **Classification:** Existing (grandfathered product with T&M HK precedent)
- **Track:** No NPA Required
- **Key Features:** Model validation already completed, Murex infrastructure in place
- **Lesson:** When a product has clear precedent and no variations, the system routes to the lightest possible track
- **Pattern:** Clear precedent + no variations = lightest track

---

### 8.2 TSG2042: NAFMII Repo China (Full NPA)
- **Product:** Pledged Bond Repo in China Interbank Bond Market (CIBM)
- **Classification:** New-to-Group (new legal framework, new market)
- **Track:** Full NPA [R11: NTG → always Full NPA]
- **Complexity:**
  - New legal framework (NAFMII vs traditional GMRA)
  - Cross-border settlement via DBS China and ABOC [R07: 5 mandatory SOPs]
  - Restricted currency handling (CNY/CNH)
  - Chinese withholding tax and VAT implications
  - Daily trade volume: RMB 4 billion in a RMB 4 trillion market
- **Lesson:** Products involving new jurisdictions and legal frameworks ALWAYS go Full NPA, regardless of how "vanilla" the underlying instrument
- **Pattern:** New jurisdiction = NTG = Full NPA + all SOPs + PIR

---

### 8.3 TSG2055: ETF Subscription (Deal-Specific)
- **Product:** Nikko AM-ICBC SG China Bond ETF subscription
- **Classification:** Deal-specific
- **Track:** Individual deal approval
- **Lesson:** Some products require individual deal approval rather than standing NPA
- **Pattern:** Specific counterparty/deal = deal-specific approval

---

### 8.4 TSG2339: Swap Connect (Full NPA)
- **Product:** Interest Rate Swaps via Swap Connect platform (cross-border HK ↔ China)
- **Classification:** NTG (new infrastructure changes operational model)
- **Track:** Full NPA [R11]
- **Key Details:**
  - Booking: `IRD|IRS|Vanilla` typology with `CNH 7DREPO 3M SWAPCON` generator
  - Portfolio: `DBSSG AMM BCB1` mapped for margin requirements
  - Legal: ISDA with novation to HKEx OTC Clear
- **Lesson:** Infrastructure/market access products require Full NPA because they change the operational model fundamentally, even if IRS itself is an existing product
- **Pattern:** New infrastructure/platform = NTG even if underlying product exists

---

### 8.5 TSG2543: Complex Structured Product (Full NPA)
- **Product:** Complex structured product across multiple asset classes
- **Classification:** NTG (multi-asset structure = new complexity)
- **Track:** Full NPA [R11]
- **Lesson:** Multi-asset products trigger multiple SOP reviews and tend to have the longest timelines
- **Pattern:** Multi-asset complexity = Full NPA + extended timeline

---

### 8.6 Common Patterns Across Real NPAs

| Pattern | Observation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Booking schema matters enormously** | Murex typology, portfolio mapping, and generator specifications are scrutinized in every NPA |
| **Legal documentation is a frequent bottleneck** | ISDA, GMRA, NAFMII agreements take time |
| **Cross-border always adds complexity** | At minimum +5 mandatory sign-offs [R07] |
| **Tax is often underestimated** | Withholding tax, VAT, transfer pricing delays |
| **PIR conditions are common** | Most Full NPAs launch with 1-2 post-launch conditions [R30-R32] |
