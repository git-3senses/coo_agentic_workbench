## Notes

1. If any section of this document is not applicable, please do not delete the section. The proposing unit (PU) should indicate "N.A." with justification.
2. The PU is ultimately responsible for ensuring the risk assessment associated with a new product service is adequate. PU should go through all risk assessment questions and assess their applicability. PU can provide responses to the question either as a whole (e.g. Question 1) or individually (e.g. Question 1a, 1b and 1c). For questions which are not applicable, PU should indicate as such and provide justification.
3. This NPA document is to be completed by the PU for a New-to-Group, Variation or Existing service product and circulated to relevant sign-off parties for review. The first draft of this document is to be uploaded into the CRM system to kick start the NPA process.
4. For a Variation or Existing service product, the PU may consider putting the product/service through an NPA Lite process. The designated staff who is appointed by the sign-off party to review this NPA document can also provide the sign-off for an NPA Lite.
5. During the review and signoff process, the sign-off parties and/or designated staff should highlight/escalate to the PU if they note that insufficient information has been provided/documented to support the responses to the risk assessment questions.
