# MAS Notice 639 / 643 — Liquidity & Exposure References (TODO stub)
**Agent:** CF_NPA_RMG  
**Suggested Dify dataset:** `COO Command Center — RMG (Liquidity/Exposure)`  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-23

## Why this file exists
You requested explicit KBs for MAS Notice **639** and **643**.

The authoritative MAS Notice PDFs are frequently accessible via MASNET or internal compliance libraries. I cannot guarantee public access to the full text.

## What to do next (recommended)
1. Export your official PDFs (or internal policy summaries) for:
   - MAS Notice 639
   - MAS Notice 643
2. Upload them into your Dify dataset for RMG.
3. Replace this stub with a structured summary:
   - purpose, scope, and applicability
   - key ratios/limits (what the agent must compute or request)
   - escalation thresholds + sign-off requirements
   - required evidence artifacts

## Interim (agent checklist)
Until the notice texts are uploaded, treat products as **high scrutiny** if they introduce:
- new liquidity risk (funding mismatch, optionality, early termination)
- new collateral/CSA constructs
- large exposures / concentration changes
