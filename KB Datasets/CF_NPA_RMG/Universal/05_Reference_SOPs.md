**Global Financial Markets (GFM) New Product Approval (NPA) Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)**

### 1000 Introduction

#### 1010 Overview
This Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) document outlines GFM methods for introducing new products. It is based on the Risk Management Group â€“ Operational Risk (RMG-OR)â€™s current â€œNew Product Approval (NPA) Policy, Standard and Guideâ€, which lays out the governance requirements and controls for the introduction of new products or making changes to existing products.

#### 1020 Objectives & Scope
1. As a Proposing Unit, the Global Financial Markets Group (GFM) uses the GFM-specific SOP to establish, implement, and operationalize a consistent new product clearance process across all GFM locations.  
2. This document should be read in conjunction with the NPA Policy, Standard and Guide issued by RMG-OR.  
3. The approving authority of this Procedure is GFM Group Chief Operating Officer (GFM COO).  
4. The Procedure is subject to a review at least every two years or as needed (for example, when significant changes to its procedures occur or the NPA Policy, Standard or Guide is revised).

### 4000 GFM NPA Classification & Clearance Type Guidelines

#### 4010 General Rules
1. The definitions in the NPA Policy, Standard and Guide are applied consistently.  
2. Prior to initiating the NPA process, PU should assess the appropriate classification of the product in accordance with the definition of new product in accordance with Section 4020 and engage the GFM COO when in doubt.  
3. Any proposals to be tabled to Product Approval Committee (â€œPACâ€) should be presented to GFM COO with justifications as to why PAC approval is required prior to the submission to PAC.  
4. In the event that GFM is the Proposing Unit in the GRC, the GFM COO shall provide the final approval after the joint-unit Head.

#### 4020 Decision Tree
1. The below table describes the general relationship between the product classification and the clearance requirement.  
2. PU and SUs may refer to pre-assessment form in Appendix 4 to determine if NPA is requiredÂ¹. In the event of consensus not reached, proposal will be escalated to GFM COO for decision.  
3. Any unresolved determination issue with the product classification and clearance method should be escalated to the GFM Group NPA Governance Forum.

Â¹ Locations may develop and apply location-specific template or decision rules based on the local NPA policy.

### 5000 GFM NPA Sign-Off Parties (SOPs) Determination Guidelines

#### 5010 General Rules
1. The signoff requirements should be determined at the beginning of the review process. PU will state the required SOPs (as determined by GFM COO) and circulate the request to all parties, including all SOPs and non-SOPs. If non-SOP parties would like to be included as SOPs, they may raise the request to be included as SOPs to GFM COO and RMG-MLR.  
2. All parties, including all SOPs and the non-SOPs, will be invited to the workgroup meetings and be informed of any new proposals. All SOPs are required to review and sign-off, unless otherwise justified.  
3. Any unresolved SOP determination issue should be escalated to the GFM Group NPA Governance Forum.  
4. Each Supporting Unit (â€œSUâ€) sign off has a 1-year validity period during the review process, to cover cases where overall sign-off process extends beyond 1 year. Expired signoffs will need to be refreshed before going to GFM COO for approval.

#### 5020 NPA Stages
The NPA life cycle is defined by 4 main stages:  
1. Pre-NPA  
2. In-flight NPA  
3. Approved NPA  
4. Post Implementation Review  

These stages seek to provide clarity on the progress of NPAs and better transparency in tracking and reporting the turnaround of NPAs.  

Refer to Appendix VIII "Overview of NPA Stages - Rebranding" for details of the individual NPA stages.

### 6000 GFM-Specific NPA/PIR/Bundling Approval Procedures
There are GFM specific processes for handling different types of NPA processes.

#### 6010 Impending Deal Approval

**NPA Type:** Impending Deal  
**Remarks:**  

**Criteria**  
To qualify for applying this express Approval process, a new product proposal must meet the following three criteria:  
2.1. NPA Lite in nature, i.e. a variation of existing products/payoffs,  
2.2. Under one or more of these scenarios:  
   â€¢ A Back-To-Back (BTB) product for which the PU can develop a valuation model within a specified timeline after the 1st trade date and obtain daily valuation from the professional BTB counterparty, in accordance to the prevailing BTB No-Model Framework policy.  
   â€¢ A dormant/expired product with no known change in system/process/booking and has passed UAT.  
   â€¢ A minor variation for which the model has been validated and UAT has completed.  
   â€¢ A Singapore-approved NPA is applicable regionally if a location trades on a BTB basis with SG, provided there are signoffs from local Compliance, Credit and Finance.  
2.3. Satisfy the approved list of conditions prescribed by support units. Refer to the Appendix II, III and IX.

**Process**  
NPA Lite  

**Timeline**  
Express Approval â€“ 48-Hour notice period  

1. On a need-to basis and under exceptional circumstances, PU may request for an urgent review for a product proposal targeted for a 48-hour notice period. If any SOP raises objections during the 48-hour notice period, Express Approval is deemed unsuccessful.  
2. An Express Approval may be brought up to GFM Group NPA Governance Forum members for their review, as necessary.  
3. PU shall provide all the required information upfront using the appropriate NPA template on the day of request. SOPs will propose to GFM the list of justification criteria and required information items. GFM will maintain and apply this list.  
4. PU may work with the NPA Working Group to update NPA documentation with relevant additional operational details (where required) within the PIR period.  
5. SOPs may propose appropriate conditions. PIR process can be applied to amend/remove these conditions after the launch.

#### 6020 NPA Lite No Objection Concurrence (NLNOC)

**NPA Type:** NLNOC  
**Remarks**  

**Criteria**  
1. GFM COO and Head of RMG-MLR have the discretion to jointly determine whether a new product needs to go through a NPA Lite process. SUs will be consulted in area of key risks and requested to provide a no-objection concurrence to go on this process.  
2. Sample scenarios include but not restricted to the following:  
   2.1 Reactivation of a dormant or expired NPA;  
   2.2 Simple change in the payoff of an approved product;  
   2.3 Simple product or process which is not covered by existing NPA.

**Process**  
NPA Lite  

**Timeline**  
Determined by PU/PU NPA Champion  

1. At initiation, PU NPA Champion would perform self-assessment on the product using the standard NPA template. PU NPA Champion will proceed to engage SUs to provide no-objection concurrence to proceed with the process. Timeline for this pre-approval consultation will be set by GFM COO OFFICE NPA Team depending on product complexity.  
2. GFM COO OFFICE NPA Team will proceed to obtain approval from GFM COO once concurrences from SUs are received.  
3. The product and its NPA documentation should be logged in the GRC system as per standard NPA lite process for proper record-keeping. The product and its NPA document will be triggered to all the respective SOPs for technical signoff in the GRC system.  
4. PIR will be initiated as per GFM internal requirement when the product is launched.  
5. The date when all the no-objection concurrences are received will be set as the date for Product kick off. Approval date will be the date when GFM COO approves the NPA proposal.

#### 6030 Fast-Track Dormant Reactivation

**NPA Type:** NPA Lite  
**Remarks**  

**Criteria**  
To qualify for this procedure, the product proposal must meet the following four criteria:  
1. There must be an existing live trade  
2. Product is not on prohibited list  
3. Post-Implementation Review (PIR) must have been completed  
4. There is no variation or changes in booking under the reactivation NPA

**Process**  
Fast Track Process  

**Timeline**  
48 Hour notice period (Express Approval)  

1. Proposing unit might have an upcoming deal of a previously approved but dormant product. The reactivation of a dormant NPA is automatic and successful if no objections are raised by any SOP during the 48-hour notice period.

#### 6040 Approved NPA Addendum

**NPA Type:** NPA Lite  
**Remarks**  

**Criteria**  
Minor/incremental updates to an existing approved NPA which is still live in status, in lieu of a NPA lite.  
Note: Any new feature or payoff to the approved NPA are not eligible for sign off via Addendum.  
Some examples of allowable updates: Adding cash/physical settlement, bi-lateral or tripartite, various typos or rewriting for clarity etc.

**Process**  
Addendum Process  

**Timeline**  
Should be brief, refer to point 5 below  

1. Minor updates sought are deemed minor not amounting to a variation. PU to propose the updates for SOPsâ€™ agreement.  
2. Original NPA document will be updated with the incremental information for SOPsâ€™ review and sign-off.  
3. Original NPA reference will be kept intact (both the GFM reference ID and the NPOS ID). Validity period of the original NPA will not be extended by the sign-off of this addendum.  
4. SOPsâ€™ decision and reason for supporting or rejecting the proposal will be recorded in the updated live NPA document.  
5. Process to poll SOPs on their support should be a quick one to minimize potential inefficiency in the event that the request does not gather the support of all SOPs and will need to be put thru the usual NPA clearance process.  
6. Signoff grid to follow that of a NPA Lite.

#### 6050 Bundling Approval

1. **Definition of Bundled products:**  
   A structure whose payoff can be replicated by combining two or more deals input in the trading systems (each of these deals is defined as a building block) is defined as a bundled product.  
   Bundling applies when legal confirmations differ from internal bookings i.e., we have a single all-encompassing Term-sheet with customer but internally we choose to book as multiple components (because our internal systems can deal with the components, pricing model validation exists for the components).  

   A Bundled Product can either be  
   (i) Approved via the NPA; or  
   (ii) Approved by the arbitration team via the Bundling Approval Process, if its individual building blocks are products that have been approved.  

   After a bundled product is approved, Front Office can proceed to trade the product. Structures falling outside the approved products scope would need to go through the Bundling Approval Process.  
   Once a bundle has been approved, it should be booked using a designated package typology.

2. **Bundling Approval Process**  
   The process flow for Bundling Approval is as follows.

3. Head of GFM COO OFFICE NPA Team, RMG-MLR, TCRM, Finance-GPC, GFMO, GFM Legal & Compliance form the Arbitration Team for this process. Heads may delegate reviewer authority to additional members within the units.Â¹  

4. An approval form for Bundling Approval (refer to Appendix I) is to be used to communicate the request to the Bundle Approval Team to seek its approval.  

   Under the Deal Particulars, the form must provide key information such as the Identifier, the breakdown component approved products, their booking schemas/payoffs/accounting treatments, elaborate on the market/credit/operation risks.  

   The following Bundling criteria are to be examined.

   **Checking of conditions:**

   | Check | Condition |
   |-------|-----------|
   | 1     | The building blocks of the transaction can be booked in Murex, Mini, FA and no new model is required | Y/N |
   | 2     | There is no proxy booking in the transaction | Y/N |
   | 3     | There is no leverage in the transaction | Y/N |
   | 4     | There are no collaterals involved in the transaction Collateral can be reviewed but it should not be automatic grounds for rejection. | Y/N |
   | 5     | There are no third parties involved in the transaction | Y/N |
   | 6     | From a product perspective, the Compliance considerations in each individual building block of the proposed bundle are complied with and there are no further Compliance issues with the proposed bundle. A filled-out Product Due Diligent (PDD) form should also be included in the bundle request for Complianceâ€™s review. | Y/N |
   | 7     | There is no SCF in the transaction (except for structured warrant bundle) | Y/N |
   | 8     | The bundle should facilitate the correct cashflow settlement. | Y/N |

5. **Approved List of Approval Products**

#### 6060 Post Implementation Review (â€œPIRâ€)

**NPA Type:** NPA Lite  
**Remarks**  

**Criteria**  
Initiated for all launched products within 6 months (or earlier if set by SOP) after the product is launched.  

**Approval**  
Signoff grid to follow that of a NPA Lite.  

**Timeline**  
Determined by PU/NPA Lead  

**Documentation**  
PIR Template  

1. As per GFM-specific more stringent practice, PIR must be initiated for all launched products within 6 months (or earlier if set by SOP) after the product is launched. Sample Live deal information to be included for PIR.  
2. Response by all SOPs is required.  
3. PIR templates are used to initiate each PIR.  
4. SOPs must review impacts on downstream processing / reporting and provide signoffs.  
5. In addition to the need that PIR be initiated within six months of the first transaction, PIR should be initiated in a timely manner that allows SUs to evaluate downstream procedures before the initial transaction has fully settled or matured and is purged from the system.  
6. SOPs are to review and sign off on a timely basis.  
7. Where issues are identified and not fully resolved, or not all variations in NPA Lite are covered by actual bookings and thus not tested, SOPs should request for PIRs to be repeated as needed.

#### 6070 NPA and Model Conditions Monitoring Working Group

1. The proposing unit must adhere to the restrictions and conditions of both the NPA and the model, which are to be tracked and monitored by their respective owners.  
2. The Risk Control Tower (RICO) allows for the monitoring of NPA restriction and conditions. The condition owner should oversee the monitoring during the time before the condition is configured in RICO. Before RICO goes live in an overseas location, the location will manually track the condition there.  
3. Regarding the model, the owner of the model is the proposing unit, while the owner of its restrictions and conditions is RMG-MLR. The MINV system currently tracks validated model mappings to the NPAs.  
4. Model reports that are relevant to a deal should always be referred to the MINV system to determine the dealâ€™s model report and conditions that must be monitored.  
5. The Working Group (WG) is made up of the NPA Sign-Off Parties (SOP), GFM Quant and GFMCOO OFFICE {Chairperson}. The WG will convene on monthly need basis to keep up with the list of conditions and their monitoring status. The condition owners are responsible for providing and ensuring that the conditions are added or updated to the list.

#### 6080 Approximate Booking Guidelines

1. **Purpose**  
   1.1 These Guidelines are to ensure systematic consideration of all risks are taken into account for a trade booking that is unable to fully represent the risks of the product.

2. **Definition of Approximate Booking:**  
   2.1 A trade with an approximate booking is one that is unable to capture fully the deal characteristics which may lead to potential issues in valuation, market, credit, and operations risks.  
   2.2 Some trades (e.g., RFR swaps with pending model validation; products with BTB-specific NPA, etc.) with approximate booking are already covered under the Back-To-Back No Valuation Model Deals Caps Clearance & Monitoring (BTB NOMOD) Framework [link]. These are not further considered in the guidelines.

3. **Assessing Booking Classification**  
   3.1 The product owner and the SUs will determine the products that fall under the approximate booking purview by evaluating them against the Approximate Booking definition.  
   3.2 The relevant GFM proposing unit(s) together with the SUs may be requested to conduct a review of an existing booking.  
   3.3 Review is also possible at the NPA stage, where an approximate booking will be determined by a set of questions (i.e., the checklist in appendix 2) that evaluate any gaps in the corresponding valuation, market, credit, and operation risks.  
   3.4 If the SUs are unsure of whether a product is considered to have an approximate booking, they may consult the NPA Governance Forum. Records of the decision made by the Forum should be maintained.

4. **In-scope Products**  
   4.1 Products that are assessed to be in-scope can be found in Appendix V.  
   4.2 The in-scope products are subject to an annual review.

5. **Excluded Products**  
   5.1 Products that are specified below are excluded from the approximate booking assessment:  
      a) Products covered under the BTB NOMOD Framework are not further considered in the guidelines but they will be listed in the approximate booking products register for completeness.

6. **Approximate Booking Assessment Checklist**  
   6.1 At the NPA stage, PU is required to fill out the Checklist and arrive at a conclusion on whether the product has an approximate booking. The Checklist will be reviewed and signed off by the relevant SUs as part of the NPA clearance process.  
   6.2 SUs may notify the NPA Team to request a review if PU concludes that the product does not have an approximate booking, but SUs believe otherwise.  
   6.3 If the product is found to have an approximate booking, it will be added to the in-scope approximate booking products register after receiving NPA approval.  
   6.4 Refer to Appendix VI for the Approximate Booking Assessment checklist.

#### 6090 Evergreen Products Process

1. **Background**  
   1.1 There is a group of products that the Bank has to be able to constantly offer, in order to demonstrate our product capabilities and to complete the suite of products available to clients. However, these products are rarely traded (due to price competitiveness issues) but must remain live in their NPA status. As maintaining NPA validity is required, this group of products must regularly go through the NPA process to stay active. This ongoing effort consumes resources and time from the NPA working group.

2. **Purpose**  
   2.1 The evergreen product process addresses this issue permitting a trade to be executed for this group of products before the reactivation of the NPA. This way, the NPA review is only triggered if a trade is executed, reducing unnecessary effort and time of having to constantly renew the NPA validity with no executed trades.  
   Evergreen product process allows for a limited number of trades to be executed even while a NPA is dormant and pending reactivation approval. This provides flexibility by enabling some trading activity within the Evergreen Product limits while still adhering to necessary controls.  
   The Evergreen Products Clearance process was approved by RMG-OR on 21st Feb 23 as a deviation to the NPA policy, standards and guides.

3. **Definition of Evergreen products:**  
   3.1 Products that need to be continuously offered to customers are known as Evergreen products.  
   3.2 The following are the general key characteristics of evergreen products (products exhibiting one or more of these characteristics). While there is no fixed rule to categorise a product as evergreen, the following guidelines can help in determining whether a product fits the classification. Final approval lies with the NPA working group.  
      (a) There have been no significant changes that constitute a variant in bookings or other risks associated with the product since it was last approved or traded.  
      (b) Products that are done on back-to-back basis.  
      (c) Products that are vanilla in nature or product that serves as the foundation for all other variants to be built upon.  
      (d) Product for liquidity management, including for DBS Group Holdings.  
      (e) Exchange products that are a hedge against customer trades.  
      (f) Origination of ABS deals to meet client demand.  

   3.3 **Out of scope NPAs:**  
      (a) A product that requires deal-by-deal approval (e.g., TSG2132 Flexi Start IRS).  
      (b) Products that have been dormant or expired for more than 3 years.  
      (c) Joint-units NPAs are not eligible as evergreen process is approved for GFM only.

4. **Working Group Assessment and Approval Process for Evergreen products**  
   4.1 Before a NPA can be classified as an evergreen product, it must undergo a review by the NPA working group. This involves evaluating the NPAâ€™s relevance and compliance to the current guidelines outlined in the Evergreen Product Definition section. The NPA working group will endorse the NPAâ€™s eligibility to be an evergreen product, which will then to be formally approved by the NPA Governance Forum.  
      PU will provide the relevant data points/information as part of their request for Evergreen products assessment and approval. Examples of information that must be submitted include if a product has live transactions in the system at the time of review; the status of the Post Implementation Review (PIR) etc.  
   4.2 For locations, there will be additional requirements to clear local SUs, local GFM Head and Country HeadÂ².  
   4.3 The locationsâ€™ Head of COO office will be responsible for checking and approving the list that will be submitted for Forumâ€™s approval.  
   4.4 If there is disagreement about whether a product should be classified as an Evergreen, GFM COO will make the final decision. If necessary, it can be escalated to the NPA Governance Forum for additional discussion or justification.  
   4.5 A FAQ (refer to appendix VII) is attached to help locationsâ€™ Supporting Units determine whether a product is eligible for evergreen products. Units should refer to this FAQ/Checklist for guidance in deciding whether a product is eligible for approval as an evergreen product.  
   4.6 **Annual review** - All approved Evergreen products that are still in active status are subject to an annual review. The evergreen products that have expired for more than 3 years or and have not been reactivated at the start of the annual review will be removed from the approved list.  
      The annual review serves the following two purposes:  
      (1) It ensures the evergreen list remains up to date by removing the NPAs with expired evergreen status.  
      (2) It acts as an interim check, without altering the existing validity, ensuring that the NPAs on the list remain eligible for evergreen status. If an event necessitates the early termination of an evergreen product, it can be performed here.  
      The annual review will be signed off by the same work group that originally reviewed and approved the list.  
   4.7 Evergreen products that have been reactivated through the NPA process (after their evergreen validity has expired or when there is a deal launched during the evergreen period) should automatically maintain their evergreen status. This means that once reactivated, their evergreen status should be active from the NPA approval date + 3 years or last transaction date during NPA validity + 3 years, without needing to be submitted for evergreen working group assessment again.

5. **Evergreen Products Limits - Trading within Deal and Size Caps**

   5.1 The limits are designed to facilitate trading for products undergoing reactivation review. These limits, encompassing deal (volume) caps and size (notional/nominal) caps, ensure control over the scale of exposure to the evergreen products during the reactivation review phase.

   5.2 The Steps for monitoring and utilising the evergreen limits are as follow:  
      a. Members of the SG NPA team will centrally manage the limits chalking process for all locations.  
      b. The latest centralised worksheet is made available to the locationsâ€™ COO Office and FO for pre-trade check.  
      c. Trade Submission: Sales and/or traders at each location will send the deal details to the group email: GFM COD SG â€“ COE NPA as soon as a trade is executed. The SG NPA team will then update the required details in the evergreen product limits worksheet to utilise the limits.  
      d. Sanity Check: The location COO Office team must confirm within 30min that all trade details populated in the worksheet are correct.  
      e. Once the trade is executed and updated in the evergreen limits worksheet, the corresponding NPA should proceed to be reactivated through the NPA Lite process.  
      f. When the NPA reactivation has been approved, location COO Office staff is to inform email: T&M-BMS-NPA for the uplifting and restoration of the evergreen limits.

   5.3 Aggregate-notional and trade-count caps for liquidity management products will be waived given its exigency nature.  
   5.4 Only the customer leg of the booking will be considered when determining the notional limits exposure and trade count i.e. the BTB leg or hedging leg will be excluded from both the notional limits calculation and the trade count. For bond issuance/distribution NPA, the deals count will be based on tranche number which is the same as the number of client-facing deals.  
   5.5 Revision of threshold for evergreen retail products from $3mio to $25mio per trade to account for larger trade size typically executed by the PB clients. There is no change to the aggregate limit at $100mio.  
   5.6 (a) Revision of trade cap for evergreen retail products from 10 deals to 20 deals. The increased trade cap is to accommodate situations where trade volumes can surge rapidly when a product is offered to retail clients. There is no change to the notional size cap for retail products.  
       (b) Revision of trade cap for non-retail products from 5 to 10 deals with no change in the aggregated limits. This is to adjust for situation where demand concentration occurs due to market condition.  
   5.7 Additional trades may be permitted subject to the approval by GFM COO with the appropriate justification to be made by PU.  
   5.8 For clarity, an NPA that is live and also has its evergreen status as live will not be subject to the evergreen limits when traded.  
   5.9 Refer to Appendix VII Appendix B for the detailed breakdown of the specific limits applied to the evergreen products.
