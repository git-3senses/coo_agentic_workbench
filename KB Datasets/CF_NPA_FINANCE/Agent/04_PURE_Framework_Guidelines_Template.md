# PURE / Data Management Framework — Template (DBS‑internal) (POC)
**Agent:** CF_NPA_FINANCE  
**Suggested Dify dataset:** `COO Command Center — Finance (PURE)`  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-23

## Purpose
DBS PURE is referenced in the NPA template and database fields (e.g., `pure_assessment_id`).
If the official PURE document is internal-only, this file provides a structured template to capture the required content.

---

## 1) PURE assessment minimum fields (template)
- PURE assessment ID:
- Data domains in scope:
- System(s) of record:
- Data owners and stewards:
- Data quality controls:
- Access controls:
- Retention and disposal:
- Change management:
- Evidence links:

---

## 2) TODO (replace with official PURE guidance)
Upload the official PURE guideline document to Dify and update this KB to match:
- definitions
- mandatory checks
- scoring/approval criteria
