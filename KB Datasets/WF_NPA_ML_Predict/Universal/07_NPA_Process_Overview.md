### 1 Purpose

1.1 This Standard supplements the New Product Approval (NPA) Policy and establishes the controls and governance standards relating to the introduction of new business initiatives or changes to existing businesses (for the purposes of this Standard, this will be referred to as â€œnew product/serviceâ€) across the DBS Group (the Group).

1.2 This Standard is applicable to all Business Units (BUs) and Support Units (SUs), branches and subsidiaries in all locations within the Group.

1.3 Where the Standard requirements differ from any regulatory requirements, the stricter of the requirements prevail, and the Risk Management Group â€“ Operational Risk (RMG-OR) should be notified accordingly.

### 2 Standard

#### 2.1 Definition of New Product/Service

â€œNew product/serviceâ€ means a new product or service that the Group intends to offer either as a principal, agent, intermediary or advisor. A new product/service is broadly classified into the following categories:

**2.1.1 New to Group**  
a. New businesses, initiatives, products/financial instruments and servicesÂ¹.  
b. New roles within a business or product group (e.g., origination, trading as principal, distribution, agency, custodian, operating an exchange and providing operations support).  
c. New distribution channels or customer segments, new exchange memberships and new markets/geographies.

**2.1.2 Variation**  
A variation to an existing product or service that alters the risk profile for the customer and/or the bank. Examples of such variation would include:  
a. Bundling or combination of existing products or services by one product unit or jointly with another product unit.  
b. Product structures which cut across banking versus trading books.  
c. Product features/structures which could potentially change the existing accounting treatment (e.g., from accrual accounting treatment to mark-to-market accounting)Â².  
d. Products/services for which significant offline or manual adjustments and workarounds are required.  
e. Products/services designed or structured with a sustainability focus or sustainability features or which have a sustainability label or name (e.g., â€œgreenâ€ deposits, â€œgreenâ€ loan).  
f. Use of advanced/innovative technology solutions to offer existing products/services (e.g., collaboration with fintech companies) that results in new or significant change(s) in business operating model.  
g. Use of new third-party hosted communication or media channels/platforms or third-party hosted communication or media channels/platforms not previously risk assessed to market or offer existing products/services. Examples of such channels/platforms include social media platforms, social or text messaging platforms etc.

Â¹ Non-financial businesses, initiatives, products/financial instruments, and services may be subject to additional regulatory requirements. Group Legal, Compliance and Secretariat (LCS) to be consulted when in doubt.  
Â² Group Finance is to be consulted when in doubt.

**2.1.3 Existing**  
a. Existing products/services within the Group which is new to a particular BU/SU or location or entity or branch notwithstanding that the same products/services have already been approved and launched by another BU/SU or location or entity.  
b. Existing products/services that have been dormant (i.e., with no transactions booked in the last one year).  
c. Approved new products/services that have not been launched within the validity period stated in 2.7.2, i.e., expired products/services.

**2.1.4 The following are excluded from the definition:**  
a. Change management initiatives (e.g., organisational structure changes, transfer of responsibilities) which do not involve a change to existing product or service.  
b. New system implementations or enhancements to an existing system where there is no change in product or service supported by the system.  
c. Process changes that are not triggered by the introduction of a new product/service or variation of an existing product/service (e.g., arising from process re-engineering initiated to improve efficiency).  
d. New operating or legal entities (e.g., via incorporation or acquisition) which are covered under separate governance or approval process.

#### 2.2 Overview of New Product/Service Life Cycle

**2.2.1** The New Product/Service Life Cycle is depicted as follows:

Stage 1  
Product Development & Business Case  

Stage 2  
New Product Approval Process  

Stage 3  
Regulatory Clearance & UAT  

Stage 4  
Launch of Product/Service  

Stage 5  
Post Implementation Review  

Product Ideation â†’ Early Engagement â†’ Business Case Approval from PAC â†’ Initiation â†’ Review & Sign-Off â†’ Approval â†’ Regulatory Notification & Engagement and UAT (where applicable) â†’ Launch â†’ Post Implementation Review & Ongoing Review

**2.2.2 Stage 1:** The proposing unit should hold discussions with relevant sign-off parties to facilitate mutual understanding of the product/service and key risks so that their inputs can be incorporated prior to circulation of the first draft of NPA proposal. Where relevant, the proposing unit should also prepare a business case for a new product/service, detailing the rationale, costs, benefits, key risks and mitigants to unit management. Where the new product/service is a New-to-Group product/service, the proposing unit, with the unit managementâ€™s support, must then submit the proposal to the Product Approval CommitteeÂ³ (PAC) for approval. Thereafter, the proposing unit should initiate the NPA process. Where applicable, the proposing unit should also ensure the new product/service is approved by the designated governance committee(s).

**2.2.3 Stage 2:** The NPA process is the process by which the proposing unit performs appropriate due diligence in respect of the new product/service, engages the relevant support units on risk assessment, and obtains sign off and approval prior to the launch of the new product/service.

Â³ PAC is a Group requirement and is not necessary at the location/entity level. However, each location/entity or Business Unit can still form its own forum to discuss and deliberate new product/service prior to tabling for Group PACâ€™s approval.

**2.2.4 Stage 3 & Stage 4:** The proposing unit should ensure risk issues and/or conditions identified during the regulatory clearance and User Acceptance Test (UAT) sign-off processes are satisfactorily addressed prior to the launch of the new product/service.

**2.2.5 Stage 5:** The proposing unit must initiate a Post Implementation Review (PIR) for all New-to-Group products/services or products/services with post-launch conditions no later than 6 months after the product/service is launched. The objective is to address any additional issues not identified or anticipated prior to the launch of the product/service and to ensure that all post launch conditions imposed by the Support Units have been addressed.

#### 2.3 Initiation

2.3.1 Prior to initiating the NPA process, the proposing unit should assess the appropriate classification of the product/service in accordance with the definition of new product/service and engage the Group BU/SU Chief Operating Officerâ´ (COO) when in doubt.

2.3.2 For NPA/NPA Lite which involves cross border booking, the relevant sign-off parties must include Finance, RMG-Credit, RMG-Market & Liquidity Risk (MLR), Technology and Operations.

2.3.3 The proposing unit should organise an NPA/NPA Lite kick-off meeting with the relevant sign-off parties to discuss the new product/service, including the risks and issues, and initiate the review process.

2.3.4 The proposing unit should agree with the relevant sign-off parties on the timeline to complete the due diligence and sign-off of the NPA/NPA Lite. Should the extension of timeline be subsequently required, the revised timeline should be mutually agreed between the proposing unit and sign-off parties.

â´ The Group BU/SU COO may also set up a regular forum to facilitate the decision-making process.

#### 2.4 Review and Sign-Off

2.4.1 The level of due diligence required of the relevant sign-off partiesâµ in their respective areas will depend on the type of product/service/business involved and where applicable, they should evaluate all potential risks to the Group and/or location, including reputational risks associated with the new product/service and recommend mitigating controls to minimise risks. The respective sign-off parties can appoint designated staffâµ to assist in the review of the NPA/NPA Lite.

2.4.2 The relevant sign-off parties for NPA/NPA Lite may set:  
a. Permanent restrictions, which should be incorporated into the features of the product/service  
b. Product parameters, which should form the scope of permissible activity, e.g., a condition stipulating that a product/service can only be offered to a specific client segment  
c. Post-launch conditions, which are generally short-term restrictions which are measurable and can be addressed by the proposing unit after the launch of the new product/service, e.g., a cap on the volume of transactions when processing is on manual basis before a system is implemented

2.4.3 For New-to-Group products/services initiated by proposing units outside Singapore, sign-offs by Head Office functions are required.

2.4.4 For non-New-to-Group products/services in:  
a. Core markets â€“ respective Group SU Heads should appoint a location sign-off party  
b. International Centres - respective Group SU Heads may appoint a location or head office sign-off party

2.4.5 Additionally, each location must ensure they meet local regulatory requirements or expectations for local sign-offs and maintain the location list of authorised sign-off parties and approving authority, where necessary.

âµ In the Bankâ€™s operational risk management system, â€œsign-off groupâ€ refers to sign-off party and designated staff.

#### 2.5 Approval

2.5.1 Upon completion of the due diligence process and prior to the launch of the new product/service, the proposing unit must obtain the approval of the Group BU/SU COO (or a party appointed by the Group Head of the proposing unitâ¶) to launch the new product/service. In addition to the above, for an NPA/NPA Lite initiated by an overseas location, the proposing unit must ensure that local approval is obtained in line with local regulations prior to obtaining Group BU/SU COOâ€™s approval. For the purpose of this Standard, they will individually and collectively be referred to as â€œthe approving authorityâ€.

â¶ Timely notification of the changes in delegation of authority for approvals must be given to RMG-OR.

#### 2.6 Regulatory Clearance and UAT

2.6.1 The NPA process is separate from the regulatory clearance and UAT processes. The proposing unit can proceed with both simultaneously.

2.6.2 While regulatory clearance and UAT sign-offs are not a condition for NPA sign-offs, the proposing unit must ensure that:  
a. Any issues and/or conditions identified during the regulatory clearance and UAT sign-off processes are satisfactorily addressed prior to the launch of the new product/service; and  
b. Re-approvals, where necessary, are obtained from the relevant sign-off parties and approving authority.

#### 2.7 Launch and Validity of Approval

2.7.1 All new product/service approvals are valid for a period of 1 year unless approval has been obtained from the relevant sign-off parties to extend the validity of the product/service approvals. If the product/service is not launchedâ· within the validity period and the proposing unit wishes to reactivate the expired product/service, the proposing unit must engage the Group BU/SU COO on the NPA and sign-off requirementsâ¸.

2.7.2 The proposing unit can request to extend the validity of an approved NPA/NPA Lite for another 6 months only once before the end of the validity period. In such a request, the proposing unit should ensure:  
a. No variation to the features of the product/service as documented in the previously approved NPA/NPA Lite;  
b. No alteration to the risk profile of the customer and/or the Bank; or  
c. No change to the operating model or the basis on which the NPA/NPA Lite was previously signed off/approved.  
The proposing unit must obtain the unanimous consensus for the extension request from the sign-off parties who have previously signed off the NPA/NPA Lite and obtain approval from the Group BU/SU COO.

â· Product/service launch can either be (i) the date the product/service is first marketed and resulted in a sale/offer or (ii) the first trade of the product. For example, an indication of DBSâ€™ interest to a customer should not be deemed as product/service launched.  
â¸ Taking into consideration changes in regulations, market conditions or changes in the underlying assumptions.

#### 2.8 PIR and Ongoing Review

2.8.1 After the launch of the product/service, the proposing unit should monitor and address post implementation issues and perform periodic reviews (which can be in the form of PIRs, review of product/services with issues identified; discussion of product/service issues at risk forums/committees, etc.)

2.8.2 The proposing unit should also initiate a PIR for the following, no later than 6 months after the product/service is launched:  
a. All New-to-Group products/services (including reactivated New-to-Group products/servicesâ¹); and  
b. Products/services with post launch conditions.

2.8.3 Where post launch conditions have been imposed by 1 or more sign-off parties, the proposing unit must track and ensure all post launch conditions are satisfied and initiate the PIR on a timely basis.

2.8.4 Sign-off parties are to sign off on the PIR once they are satisfied that the required conditions have been complied with.

2.8.5 Group Audit will include the new products/services into its audit risk assessment and will conduct PIR(s) where necessary.

â¹ Reactivated New-to-Group products/services are products/services that are not launched within 1 year (or the approved extended validity period) from the approval date and are subsequently re-activated via an NPA process.

#### 2.9 Escalation

2.9.1 In the event that any unit encounters a new product/service that will be/has been launched or transacted without undergoing the NPA process, the unit should initiate the NPA process without delay and escalate the matter to:  
a. The Group BU/SU COO of the unit that intends to launch or has launched the new product/service; and  
b. RMG-OR (or RMG-OR at entities/overseas locations).

2.9.2 Escalation to the Group BU/SU COO, Location Head and the relevant risk and control committees or forums (e.g., unit-specific NPA forum) is required for:  
a. Unresolved and/or contentious issues between the proposing unit and the sign-off parties in any stage of the NPA process; and  
b. Issues concerning non-fulfilment or non-compliance with conditions imposed and timeliness of the review/sign-off.

2.9.3 Where any issue exposes the Group to higher levels of reputational risk, Group BU/SU COO together with Group Compliance and RMG-OR should bring the concerns to the attention of the PAC.

#### 2.10 Maintenance of Records

2.10.1 The proposing unit should keep all relevant documents of the NPA (including the associated PIR, etc.) in the Bankâ€™s operational risk management system. Documentation of decision and justifications for not conducting an NPA/NPA Lite review should also be maintained.

### Appendix 3 Any Additional Information or Materials

Overview of the type of NPAs and PIR requirements:

| Type of NPAs                                      | PIR    | Remarks |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|
| Full NPA<br>New to Group (NTG)                    | Yes, even if no conditions are imposed. | Such review: 1. Provides confirmation that the requirements/information documented in the approved NPA are adhered to; and 2. Addresses any additional issues not identified or anticipated prior to the launch of product/service and the actions taken towards resolution of the issues. In addition, the PIR is intended to assess the performance against the original expectation, and the results of PIR including lessons learnt and experiences from such launching can be considered for the development of new products/services which is a variation of an existing product/service. All relevant sign-off parties are to be engaged. |
| Re-activate an expired NTG NPA with new additions or changes to previously approved NTG NPA | As above | As above |
| Non-NTG                                           | No, unless conditions are imposed. | Sign-off parties who imposed conditions must sign-off the PIR. |
| NPA Lite (e.g., dormant/expired products/services, product/service variations) |        |         |
| Re-activate an expired NTG NPA where there are no changes to the previously approved NTG NPA | Yes | This applies even when no conditions are imposed on the NPA Lite, as this is deemed as an â€œextensionâ€ of the full NPA and thus the same PIR requirements will apply. All relevant sign-off parties are to be engaged. |
| A product/service that is new to location/entity/branch/unit, which references to an NTG NPA | (1) Yes, if PIR is not completed for the referenced NTG product/service.<br>(2) No, if PIR was completed for the referenced NTG product/service. | This applies even when no conditions are imposed on the NPA Lite at location/entity/branch/unit. |
| With conditions                                   | Yes    | Sign-off parties who imposed conditions must sign off the PIR. |
| Without conditions                                | No     |         |
