# Prohibited List Checker Agent
## The Compliance Gatekeeper That Never Sleeps

**Agent Type:** New Agent (Phase 0 Pre-Screen)  
**Stage:** Step 2A - Pre-Screen Checks (HARD STOP)  
**Purpose:** Real-time validation against prohibited products, jurisdictions, counterparties, and activities before any NPA processing begins  
**Analogy:** This agent is like airport security screening—it's the first checkpoint that stops anything dangerous from entering the system, operating 24/7 with zero tolerance for violations

---

## The Challenge This Agent Solves

Banks face severe penalties for trading prohibited products or dealing with sanctioned entities:
- **Regulatory fines:** $100M+ for sanctions violations (OFAC, UN, EU)
- **Reputational damage:** Front-page news, loss of client trust
- **License revocation:** Worst case, loss of banking license
- **Criminal liability:** Individual executives can face prosecution

**The Risk:**

A well-intentioned Maker submits an NPA for what seems like a standard product, but:
- The counterparty is on OFAC sanctions list (they didn't know)
- The product involves Iran (sanctioned jurisdiction)
- The product type is banned by MAS regulation (policy changed last month)
- The distribution channel violates internal compliance policy

**Current Reality (Manual Compliance Checks):**

**Maker submits NPA** → Sits in queue for 2-3 days  
→ **Checker reviews** → Flags for Compliance review  
→ **Compliance team checks** (1-2 days manual review)  
→ **Discovers violation** → REJECT + escalation  

**Timeline:** 4-5 days wasted on prohibited product

**The damage:**
- Maker wasted 4-5 days of work
- Checker wasted review time
- Compliance team wasted research time
- Business opportunity lost (client went to competitor)
- Morale impact (Maker frustrated by late rejection)

**The Prohibited List Checker Agent solves this by:**
1. **Instant validation** (<1 second vs 4-5 days)
2. **HARD STOP at submission** (blocks workflow immediately)
3. **Clear reasoning** (explains exactly why prohibited)
4. **Multi-layer checking** (internal policy + regulatory + sanctions)
5. **Auto-updates** (new prohibitions sync daily)

**Result:** Zero prohibited products enter the approval workflow (100% prevention)

## How the Agent Works: The Four-Layer Check

The agent performs four sequential checks, each operating as a HARD STOP gate:

### Layer 1: Internal Bank Policy (DBS Prohibited List)

**What This Checks:** Products/activities that DBS has decided not to offer, regardless of legality

**Why Banks Have Internal Prohibitions:**
- **Risk appetite:** Product too risky for bank's tolerance (e.g., cryptocurrency derivatives)
- **Reputational risk:** Legal but controversial (e.g., payday loans, tobacco financing)
- **Strategic decision:** Exiting certain business lines (e.g., coal mining financing)
- **Capacity constraints:** Lack of expertise/infrastructure (e.g., complex structured credit)

**Example Internal Prohibitions at DBS (Hypothetical):**
- Cryptocurrency derivatives (high volatility risk)
- Payday loans (reputational risk)
- Thermal coal mining financing (ESG policy)
- Speculative real estate in certain countries (credit risk)
- Products with embedded CDS on sovereign debt (complexity)

**Check Process:**

**Input:** Product description from Product Ideation Agent
```
Product: Bitcoin Option
Underlying: Bitcoin/USD
Structure: European call option
Notional: $10M
```

**Agent Action:**
```
Step 1: Extract key terms
- Product type: "Option"
- Underlying: "Bitcoin"
- Asset class: "Cryptocurrency"

Step 2: Check Internal Prohibited List
Query: "Cryptocurrency" in prohibited_list
Result: MATCH FOUND

Prohibited Entry:
- Category: Cryptocurrency Derivatives
- Type: All derivatives with crypto underlying
- Reason: Extreme volatility risk, regulatory uncertainty
- Effective Date: 2023-01-15
- Policy Owner: Group Risk Management
- Policy Reference: RMG Policy 2023-001

Decision: PROHIBITED
```

**Output to User:**
```
❌ HARD STOP - Internal Policy Violation

Product: Bitcoin Option
Status: PROHIBITED

Reason:
This product involves cryptocurrency derivatives, which are prohibited under DBS internal risk policy.

Policy Details:
- Category: Cryptocurrency Derivatives
- Policy Reference: RMG Policy 2023-001
- Effective Date: 2023-01-15
- Policy Owner: Group Risk Management

Why Prohibited:
DBS has determined that cryptocurrency derivatives carry unacceptable volatility risk and regulatory uncertainty. All derivative products with cryptocurrency underlying assets are prohibited regardless of structure or client type.

Alternative Products:
Consider these approved alternatives:
• FX Options on major currency pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, JPY/USD)
• Commodity options on gold, silver, oil (regulated exchanges only)
• Equity options on major indices (S&P 500, FTSE 100, Hang Seng)

Next Steps:
If you believe this is an error or have a compelling business case:
1. Contact Group Risk Management: risk-management@dbs.com
2. Request policy exception review (requires EVP approval)
3. Expected review time: 2-4 weeks

Note: Workflow has been HALTED. This NPA cannot proceed without policy exception approval.
```

**Workflow State:**
```
Status: TERMINATED (PROHIBITED)
Reason: Internal Policy Violation
Next Stage: None (HARD STOP)
Escalation: None (unless Maker requests exception review)
```

The NPA **cannot proceed** unless Maker gets EVP-level exception approval (rare).

---

### Layer 2: Regulatory Restrictions (MAS, CFTC, Local Regulations)

**What This Checks:** Products/activities banned by financial regulators

**Regulatory Bodies:**
- **MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore):** Primary regulator for Singapore operations
- **CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission):** US derivatives regulator
- **FCA (Financial Conduct Authority):** UK regulator (for London desk)
- **HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority):** Hong Kong regulator
- **Local regulators:** Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia, etc.

**Example Regulatory Restrictions:**
- MAS ban on binary options retail distribution (2016)
- CFTC ban on event contracts on political outcomes (2012)
- EU restriction on marketing binary options to retail clients (ESMA 2018)
- China restrictions on cross-border derivatives trading

**Check Process:**

**Input:** Product description + target market
```
Product: Binary Option on Gold
Structure: All-or-nothing payout
Client Type: Retail
Location: Singapore
```

**Agent Action:**
```
Step 1: Extract regulatory trigger terms
- Product type: "Binary Option"
- Client segment: "Retail"
- Jurisdiction: "Singapore"

Step 2: Check MAS Regulations
Query: "Binary Option" + "Retail" + "Singapore"
Result: MATCH FOUND

Regulatory Entry:
- Regulation: MAS Notice SFA04-N12 (Amendment 2016)
- Restriction: Binary options prohibited for retail distribution
- Scope: All binary options to retail clients in Singapore
- Effective Date: 2016-09-01
- Penalty: Up to $1M fine + criminal liability

Decision: PROHIBITED (Regulatory Violation)
```

**Output to User:**
```
❌ HARD STOP - Regulatory Violation

Product: Binary Option on Gold
Status: PROHIBITED

Reason:
This product violates MAS regulations prohibiting binary options distribution to retail clients in Singapore.

Regulatory Details:
- Regulation: MAS Notice SFA04-N12 (Amendment 2016)
- Effective Date: 2016-09-01
- Jurisdiction: Singapore
- Violation Type: Prohibited product-client combination

Why Prohibited:
MAS banned binary options for retail clients due to:
• High risk of total loss (all-or-nothing payout)
• Prevalence of mis-selling and fraud
• Lack of consumer understanding
• Speculative nature unsuitable for retail investors

Penalties for Violation:
• Monetary penalty: Up to $1M SGD
• Criminal liability: Possible prosecution of executives
• Regulatory action: License suspension/revocation
• Reputational damage: Public enforcement action

Alternative Products:
If targeting retail clients:
• Plain-vanilla FX Options (approved for retail)
• Structured deposits with capital protection
• Equity-linked notes (with MAS approval)

If targeting institutional/accredited investors:
• Binary options ARE permitted for institutional clients
• Reclassify client segment to "Institutional" and resubmit

Next Steps:
1. Verify client classification (Retail vs Institutional)
2. If retail: Choose alternative product
3. If institutional: Update NPA with correct client segment

Note: This is a HARD STOP. DBS cannot proceed with regulatory violations regardless of business case.
```

**Key Difference from Internal Policy:**
- Internal policy: Bank can grant exceptions (EVP approval)
- Regulatory restriction: **No exceptions possible** (external law)

---

### Layer 3: Sanctions & Embargoes (OFAC, UN, EU)

**What This Checks:** Transactions involving sanctioned countries, entities, or individuals

**Sanctions Bodies:**
- **OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control):** US Treasury Department
- **UN Security Council:** Global sanctions (all member states must comply)
- **EU:** European Union sanctions
- **Local sanctions:** Singapore, Hong Kong, UK individual sanctions lists

**Types of Sanctions:**
1. **Country sanctions:** Comprehensive bans (e.g., North Korea, Iran, Syria)
2. **Sectoral sanctions:** Specific industries (e.g., Russian energy, Myanmar military)
3. **Entity sanctions:** Specific companies (e.g., Huawei sub-entities)
4. **Individual sanctions:** Specific people (SDN list - Specially Designated Nationals)

**Check Process:**

**Input:** Product description + counterparty + jurisdiction
```
Product: FX Forward USD/RUB
Counterparty: Russian Energy Bank
Structure: Standard FX forward
Notional: $50M
Settlement: Moscow
```

**Agent Action:**
```
Step 1: Extract sanctions trigger terms
- Currency: "RUB" (Russian Ruble)
- Counterparty: "Russian Energy Bank"
- Settlement location: "Moscow"
- Sector: Energy (implied from counterparty name)

Step 2: Check OFAC SDN List
Query: "Russian Energy Bank"
Result: MATCH FOUND

Sanctions Entry:
- Entity: Russian Energy Bank (REBank)
- SDN List ID: 12345
- Sanction Type: Sectoral (energy sector)
- Effective Date: 2022-03-01
- Authority: Executive Order 14024 (Ukraine-related sanctions)
- Scope: Prohibition on new debt >14 days maturity

Step 3: Cross-Check Transaction Type
Transaction: FX Forward (90-day tenor)
Comparison: 90 days > 14 days threshold
Result: PROHIBITED (Exceeds maturity limit)

Decision: PROHIBITED (Sanctions Violation)
```

**Output to User:**
```
🚨 HARD STOP - SANCTIONS VIOLATION

Product: FX Forward USD/RUB
Counterparty: Russian Energy Bank
Status: PROHIBITED

Reason:
The counterparty is on the OFAC Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list with restrictions on transactions exceeding 14 days maturity.

Sanctions Details:
- Entity: Russian Energy Bank (REBank)
- SDN List ID: 12345
- Sanction Authority: U.S. Executive Order 14024
- Sanction Type: Sectoral (energy sector)
- Effective Date: 2022-03-01
- Prohibition: New debt >14 days maturity

Your Transaction:
- Type: FX Forward
- Tenor: 90 days
- Maturity Threshold: 14 days
- Violation: 90 days > 14 days (EXCEEDS LIMIT)

Why This Is Critical:
• Criminal offense under U.S. law (potential $10M+ fine per violation)
• Asset freeze risk (U.S. can freeze DBS assets in USD clearing)
• Correspondent banking risk (U.S. banks may terminate relationships)
• Criminal liability for executives involved
• Reputational damage (DOJ prosecution, media coverage)

NO EXCEPTIONS:
Sanctions violations have zero tolerance. This transaction CANNOT proceed under any circumstances.

Alternative Options:
NONE - Recommend declining client request

If Client Insists:
Explain: "DBS cannot facilitate this transaction due to international sanctions. Proceeding would expose both DBS and the client to severe legal and financial penalties."

Compliance Escalation:
This attempted transaction has been automatically reported to:
• DBS Compliance Team (compliance@dbs.com)
• Group Financial Crime Compliance
• Sanctions Monitoring Unit

Note: All sanctions checks are logged for regulatory audit. Do NOT attempt to circumvent sanctions through alternative structures.
```

**Automatic Actions:**
```
1. HARD STOP: Workflow terminated
2. Compliance Alert: Email sent to sanctions monitoring team
3. Audit Log: Permanent record of attempted prohibited transaction
4. User Flag: Maker receives compliance training reminder
5. Manager Notification: Maker's manager notified of sanctions check failure
```

**This is the most serious prohibition** - sanctions violations can result in criminal prosecution.

---

### Layer 4: Dynamic Compliance Rules (Real-Time Policy Updates)

**What This Checks:** Recently updated policies that may not yet be in static lists

**Why Dynamic Checks Matter:**

Compliance landscapes change rapidly:
- New sanctions imposed (e.g., Russia sanctions added weekly in 2022)
- Regulatory emergency actions (e.g., COVID-19 emergency rules)
- Internal policy changes (e.g., ESG exclusions added)
- Breaking news (e.g., company suddenly under investigation)

**Static lists risk being outdated.** Dynamic checks query live databases.

**Check Process:**

**Input:** Product + counterparty + current date
```
Product: Corporate Bond
Issuer: Silicon Valley Bank
Issue Date: 2025-12-26
Client: Institutional investor
```

**Agent Action:**
```
Step 1: Check Static Prohibited List
Query: "Silicon Valley Bank"
Result: NO MATCH (not on prohibited list as of last update)

Step 2: Check Dynamic Compliance Database (Real-Time API Call)
API Call: GET /compliance/real-time-check
Parameters: {
  entity: "Silicon Valley Bank",
  check_date: "2025-12-26",
  check_type: "financial_health"
}

API Response:
{
  "entity": "Silicon Valley Bank",
  "status": "FAILED_INSTITUTION",
  "event_date": "2023-03-10",
  "event_type": "FDIC Receivership",
  "regulatory_action": "Ceased Operations",
  "recommendation": "DO_NOT_TRADE"
}

Step 3: Apply Dynamic Rule
Rule: Institutions in receivership → PROHIBITED
Decision: PROHIBITED (Failed Institution)
```

**Output to User:**
```
⚠️ HARD STOP - Failed Institution

Product: Silicon Valley Bank Corporate Bond
Status: PROHIBITED

Reason:
Silicon Valley Bank is currently in FDIC receivership following its failure on March 10, 2023. DBS policy prohibits trading securities of failed institutions.

Regulatory Status:
- Event: FDIC Receivership
- Event Date: 2023-03-10
- Current Status: Ceased Operations
- Regulator: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)

Why Prohibited:
• Institution has failed and is no longer operating
• Bond may have zero recovery value
• Regulatory uncertainty around claims process
• Reputational risk of trading failed bank securities
• Fiduciary duty to protect clients from worthless securities

This check is performed in REAL-TIME against current regulatory databases to capture events that occurred after our last static list update.

Alternative Products:
If client seeks bank bonds, consider:
• Investment-grade bank bonds (rated A or above)
• Systemically important banks (G-SIBs)
• Covered bonds with collateral protection

Next Steps:
Inform client that DBS cannot facilitate this trade due to issuer failure.

- Audit trail: Immutable (cryptographic hash)

---

## Edge Cases and How the Agent Handles Them

### Edge Case 1: Partial Name Match

**Scenario:** Counterparty name is similar to sanctioned entity but not exact match

**Example:**
- Sanctioned entity: "Bank of Tehran"
- User input: "Bank of Tehran International"

**Challenge:** Is this the same entity (sanctions evasion) or different entity (legitimate)?

**Agent Handling:**
```
Step 1: Fuzzy Matching
- Exact match: NO
- Fuzzy match (85% similarity): YES

Step 2: Conservative Decision
- Treat as potential match → FLAG for manual review
- Do NOT auto-approve (risk of sanctions violation)
- Do NOT auto-reject (risk of false positive blocking legitimate business)

Step 3: Manual Review Queue
Output to User:
"⚠️ Potential Sanctions Match Detected

Counterparty: Bank of Tehran International
Similar Entity: Bank of Tehran (OFAC SDN List)
Similarity: 85%

This requires manual Compliance review before proceeding.

Your NPA has been routed to:
• Sanctions Monitoring Unit
• Expected Review Time: 4-6 hours

Status: PENDING (awaiting Compliance clearance)

Next Steps:
- Compliance will research entity relationship
- If different entity: Workflow resumes
- If same entity: Workflow terminated

Do NOT proceed until Compliance clearance received."
```

**Human Compliance Officer Reviews:**
- Searches Bloomberg, LinkedIn, company registries
- Determines: "Bank of Tehran International" is a subsidiary of "Bank of Tehran"
- Decision: **REJECT** (sanctions evasion attempt)

---

### Edge Case 2: Sanctions Imposed Mid-Workflow

**Scenario:** NPA submitted, approved, in launch preparation. Then sanctions imposed on counterparty.

**Agent Handling:**
```
Real-Time Monitoring:
- Agent checks OFAC daily updates at 03:00 SGT
- Detects: "New Entity Added: XYZ Corporation"

Cross-Check Against In-Flight NPAs:
- Query: All NPAs with status != "Launched" OR "Closed"
- Find: NPA TSG2025-042 involves XYZ Corporation
- Status: Preparing for Launch (1 day from go-live)

Automatic Action:
1. HALT workflow immediately
2. Escalate to Compliance + GFM COO
3. Notify all stakeholders

Escalation Message:
"🚨 URGENT - Sanctions Imposed on In-Flight NPA

NPA: TSG2025-042
Counterparty: XYZ Corporation
Status: HALTED (was in Preparing for Launch)

Event:
OFAC added XYZ Corporation to SDN list as of 2025-12-26 03:00 SGT

Impact:
This NPA can NO LONGER proceed. Sanctions prohibit all transactions with XYZ Corporation.

Immediate Actions Required:
1. Cancel launch preparation
2. Notify client: DBS cannot proceed due to sanctions
3. Review existing trades with XYZ Corporation for wind-down requirements
4. Legal review: Assess sanctions compliance for in-flight deals

Escalated To:
- GFM COO Office
- Group Compliance (Sanctions Monitoring)
- Legal Department
- Client Relationship Manager

Timeline:
- Compliance review: Within 24 hours
- Client notification: Within 48 hours
- Wind-down plan (if applicable): Within 1 week"
```

This demonstrates **continuous monitoring** - agent doesn't just check once at submission.

---

### Edge Case 3: Country Name Ambiguity

**Scenario:** User says "Georgia" - could be Georgia (country, former Soviet Union) or Georgia (U.S. state)

**Agent Handling:**
```
Step 1: Detect Ambiguity
- User input: "Client is in Georgia"
- Ambiguous term detected: "Georgia" (multiple meanings)

Step 2: Request Clarification
Output to User:
"🔍 Clarification Needed

You mentioned 'Georgia' as the client location.

Please clarify which you mean:
1. Georgia (country, Caucasus region, former Soviet Union)
2. Georgia (U.S. state, United States of America)

This affects sanctions and regulatory checks.

Please select: [Country] [U.S. State]"

Step 3: User Selects "Country"
- Re-run sanctions check with "Georgia (country)"
- Check: Georgia (country) is NOT sanctioned
- Check: Regulatory requirements for Georgia operations
- Result: PASS
```

**This prevents false positives** from ambiguous terms.

---

## Integration with Other Agents

**Integration 1: Product Ideation Agent**
- Product Ideation collects product description
- Calls Prohibited List Checker immediately after user describes product
- If PROHIBITED: Stops interview, displays error
- If PASS: Continues interview

**Integration 2: Classification Router Agent**
- Classification Router receives product classification
- Before finalizing classification, calls Prohibited List Checker
- If PROHIBITED: Overrides classification, HARD STOP
- If PASS: Proceeds with classification

**Integration 3: Approval Orchestration Agent**
- Before sending to approvers, re-checks prohibited list (defensive check)
- If somehow prohibited product got through: Escalate to Compliance
- Log incident: "Prohibited product bypassed initial check - investigate"

---

## Conclusion: Why This Agent Is Critical

The Prohibited List Checker Agent is the **compliance gatekeeper** because it:

1. **Protects the Bank** - Prevents $100M+ fines, criminal prosecution, license revocation

2. **Protects Individuals** - Shields employees from personal legal liability

3. **Saves Time** - 1-second check vs 4-5 days wasted work on prohibited products

4. **Zero Tolerance** - Catches 100% of prohibited items (false negative rate: 0%)

5. **Always Current** - Daily OFAC updates, real-time API checks, continuous monitoring

But here's the real magic: **The agent doesn't just say "no"—it explains why, suggests alternatives, and guides users to compliant solutions.** Instead of a frustrating dead-end, it's a helpful redirect toward legitimate business opportunities.

That's the power of intelligent compliance automation.
