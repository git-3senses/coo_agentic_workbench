# NPA Database Data Flow: Simple Explanation
## Following Sarah's $75M FX Option Journey Through the Database

**No Code, No Syntax - Just the Story of Data**

---

## The Big Picture: What Happens to Data?

Think of the database as a **giant filing cabinet** with different drawers for different types of information. As Sarah creates her NPA and it moves through the system, data gets written into various drawers, and the agents read from these drawers to make decisions.

**The 7 Main Filing Drawers:**

1. **NPA Drawer** - The main NPA record (like a master file folder)
2. **Properties Drawer** - All 47 template fields (individual index cards)
3. **Documents Drawer** - All uploaded files (physical documents)
4. **Sign-Offs Drawer** - Approval status from each department (signature sheets)
5. **Workflow Drawer** - Current status and progress (status board)
6. **Memory Drawer** - Vector embeddings for finding similar NPAs (library catalog)
7. **Audit Drawer** - Every action logged (security camera footage)

## Sarah's Journey: Step-by-Step Data Flow

### **Monday, 09:00 AM - Sarah Opens NPA Workbench**

**What Happens:**
1. System checks: "Who is this user?"
2. Looks in **Users Drawer**
3. Finds: Sarah Lim, Singapore FX Desk, Role = Maker

**Data Created:**
```
Users Drawer (already exists):

### **09:02 AM - Sarah Starts Conversation (Question 1)**

**Sarah types:** "It's an FX option on GBP/USD..."

**What Happens:**
1. Product Ideation Agent reads Sarah's answer
2. Extracts: Product Type = FX Option

### **09:12 AM - KB Search Finds TSG1917**

**What Happens:**
1. KB Search Agent looks in **Memory Drawer** (vector embeddings)
2. Finds: TSG1917 is 94% similar
3. Writes similarity link to **NPA Drawer**

**Memory Drawer (SEARCH):**
```
Vector Embeddings (read from):
├─ TSG1917: [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...] → 94% match
├─ TSG1823: [0.098, -0.521, 0.654, ...] → 88% match

## Real-Time Dashboard: How It Works

**Sarah Opens Dashboard:**

1. **Browser sends request:** "Show me TSG2025-042 status"

2. **Database looks in Sign-Offs Drawer:**
   - Reads all 6 sign-off records
   - Calculates hours elapsed for each
   - Calculates SLA remaining for each

3. **Database returns:**
   ```
   Credit: APPROVED (20.5 hrs)
   Finance: APPROVED (26 hrs)
   Finance VP: APPROVED (1 hr)
   MLR: APPROVED (20 hrs)
   Operations: APPROVED (3.5 hrs)
   Technology: APPROVED (19.2 hrs)
   
   Overall: 100% complete
   ```

4. **Browser displays live dashboard**

**When Finance Approves (Tuesday 04:00 PM):**

1. **Mark clicks "Approve"**
2. **Database writes:** Sign-Offs Drawer, Finance → APPROVED
3. **Realtime subscription fires:** "HEY! Finance status changed!"
4. **Sarah's browser instantly updates:** Shows Finance checkmark ✅
5. **No page refresh needed** - Updates in <100ms

## Key Insights: Data Flow Principles

### **1. Single Source of Truth**

Each piece of data has ONE home:
- **NPA status?** → NPA Drawer
- **Sign-off status?** → Sign-Offs Drawer
- **Documents?** → Documents Drawer
- **User info?** → Users Drawer

No duplicate data, no confusion.

---

### **2. Linked by Relationships**

Data is connected like family tree:
```
NPA (parent)
├── Properties (children - 47 fields)
├── Documents (children - 13 files)
├── Sign-Offs (children - 6 approvers)
└── Comments (children - questions/answers)
```

Delete NPA → All children automatically deleted (cascade)

---

### **3. Read vs Write**

**Agents READ data to make decisions:**
- ML Prediction reads: Product type, notional, cross-border
- KB Search reads: Vector embeddings
- Classification Router reads: Product description, precedents

**Agents WRITE their decisions:**
- Classification: "EXISTING (Variation), 88% confidence"
- ML Prediction: "78% approval, 4.2 days"
- Template Auto-Fill: 37 fields → Properties Drawer

---

### **4. Immutable Audit Trail**

**Activity Log = Security Camera:**
- Records EVERYTHING
- Cannot be edited or deleted
- Linked like blockchain (each row points to previous)
- 7-year retention for regulators

## The Filing Cabinet Analogy

Imagine a physical office:

**NPA Drawer** = Main file folder on desk  
**Properties Drawer** = Index card box (47 cards, one per field)  
**Documents Drawer** = File cabinet with hanging folders  
**Sign-Offs Drawer** = Signature sheet circulating between 6 desks  
**Workflow Drawer** = Status board on wall  
**Memory Drawer** = Library catalog system  
**Audit Drawer** = Security camera footage (cannot erase)

When Sarah creates NPA:
1. Open new main folder
2. Write on 47 index cards
3. Add documents to hanging folders
4. Pass signature sheet to 6 people
5. Update status board
6. Security camera records everything

When agents need info:
1. Open main folder (read NPA Drawer)
2. Look at index cards (read Properties Drawer)
3. Check signature sheet (read Sign-Offs Drawer)
4. Search library catalog (vector search)

When approvers sign-off:
1. Sign signature sheet
2. Return to circulation
3. Status board auto-updates
4. Security camera logs signature

**Simple, organized, traceable.**
