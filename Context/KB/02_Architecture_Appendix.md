Executive Summary
The COO Multi-Agent Workbench is an enterprise-grade, unified agentic AI platform designed to orchestrate and automate complex workflows across all seven functions under the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Trading & Markets (T&M) at DBS Bank.
This platform represents a paradigm shift from function-specific siloed systems to an integrated, intelligent command center where AI agents collaborate across domains, share knowledge, and autonomously execute tasks while maintaining human oversight and regulatory compliance.
Primary Objective: Reduce manual operational overhead by 60%, improve decision quality by 40%, and enable real-time visibility into all COO operations through intelligent automation.

1. Vision & Strategic Context
1.1 The Challenge
The COO Office at DBS T&M manages seven critical functions spanning across Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Korea, London, and Japan:
1. Desk Support (12 operational pillars)
2. New Product Assessment (NPA) (6-stage lifecycle)
3. Strategic Programme Management
4. Business Lead & Analysis
5. Operational Risk Management (ORM)
6. DCE Client Services (200+ SOPs)
7. Business Analysis & Planning
Current State Challenges:
* Fragmented Systems: NPA House, ROBO, RICO, DEGA 2.0, BCP operate in isolation
* Manual Workflows: 70% of processes involve manual document handling, email chains, spreadsheet updates
* Knowledge Silos: Domain expertise trapped in individual team members, not systematically captured
* Inconsistent Decision-Making: Approval timelines vary wildly (NPA: 5-25 days), heavily dependent on individual approver availability
* Limited Visibility: Management lacks real-time view into bottlenecks, agent health, or cross-functional dependencies
* Scalability Constraints: Current headcount cannot support regional expansion without proportional cost increase

2. System Architecture
2.1 Architecture Philosophy
The workbench follows a 4-tier hierarchical agent architecture inspired by enterprise-grade agentic AI principles:


Tier 1: Master Orchestrator (The Brain)
   â†“
Tier 2: Domain Agents (7 Function-Specific Agents)
   â†“
Tier 3: Sub-Agents (Stage-Based Specialists)
   â†“
Tier 4: Utility Agents (Shared Infrastructure)
Design Principles:
1. Agent-Centric Design: Every function is represented by a Domain Agent that acts as a single point of orchestration
2. 5-Stage Workflow Pattern: All workflows decompose into Ingestion â†’ Triage â†’ Diligence â†’ Decisioning â†’ Reporting
3. Shared Utility Layer: Common capabilities (KB, notifications, integrations) are reused across domains
4. State Machine Foundation: Every workflow has an explicit state machine with valid transitions enforced
5. Human-in-the-Loop by Design: Agents augment, not replace, human decision-making
6. Explainability First: Every agent decision includes reasoning, confidence scores, and source citations
2.2 Tier 1: Master Orchestrator
Role: The central brain that routes requests, coordinates cross-domain workflows, and monitors overall system health.
Responsibilities:
* Request Routing: Determine which Domain Agent should handle incoming requests
* Cross-Domain Coordination: Orchestrate workflows that span multiple functions (e.g., NPA requiring Desk Support input)
* Load Balancing: Distribute work across agents based on availability and performance
* Conflict Resolution: Handle cases where multiple agents have overlapping responsibilities
* System Health Monitoring: Track all agents, detect failures, trigger alerts
* Priority Management: Escalate urgent items, de-prioritize routine tasks
* Audit Trail: Log all orchestration decisions for compliance
Technology:
* Framework: Dify Master Agent with custom orchestration logic

Document Version: 1.1 Enhanced Last Updated: December 2025 Next Review: January 2026

ENHANCED SECTIONS (Addressing Identified Gaps)

11. NPA 6-Stage Lifecycle Deep Dive
11.1 Understanding the NPA Journey
While the workbench documentation references the 5-stage pipeline pattern (Ingestion â†’ Triage â†’ Diligence â†’ Decisioning â†’ Reporting), the NPA workflow specifically follows a 6-stage business lifecycle that maps to real-world operations:
NPA 6-Stage Lifecycle:
1. Discovery Stage â†’ Product concept initiated
2. Review Stage â†’ Maker submission, Checker validation, iterative refinement
3. Sign-Off Stage â†’ Parallel multi-department approvals (Credit, Finance, Legal)
4. Preparing for Launch Stage â†’ Operational readiness, system configuration
5. Ready for Launch Stage â†’ Final pre-launch checks
6. Launched + PIR/Monitoring Stage â†’ Post-implementation review, ongoing monitoring
Key Distinction:
* The 5-stage pipeline (Ingestion â†’ Triage â†’ Diligence â†’ Decisioning â†’ Reporting) describes how AI agents process tasks within each stage.
* The 6-stage lifecycle describes the business workflow stages that an NPA progresses through from conception to post-launch.
Example Mapping: When an NPA is in the Review Stage (Stage 2 of 6), the AI agents use the 5-stage pipeline to process it:
* Ingestion: Accept Maker's submission documents
* Triage: Check completeness, flag missing fields
* Diligence: Search similar historical NPAs, validate compliance
* Decisioning: Recommend approve/clarify/reject to Checker
* Reporting: Generate review summary for Checker
11.2 Non-Linearity and Loop-Backs in NPA
Critical Reality: NPA workflows are non-linear due to:
* Maker-Checker Iterations: Checker rejects â†’ loops back to Maker for fixes
* Approval Clarifications: Approver requests more info â†’ loops back (either to Maker or answered directly)
* Launch Delays: Issues during prep â†’ loops back to earlier stage
* Post-Launch Issues: Problems discovered after launch â†’ triggers corrective action
Loop-Back Scenarios:
Scenario 1: Checker Rejection (Major Loop-Back)


Maker Submits (Discovery) â†’ Checker Reviews â†’ REJECTS
                             â†“
            Loop-Back to Maker (Draft/Discovery Stage)
                             â†“
            Maker Fixes â†’ Re-submits â†’ Checker Reviews Again
Impact: Adds 3-5 days per iteration. Average: 1.4 iterations per NPA.
Scenario 2: Approval Clarification (Smart Loop-Back)


Credit Approver Reviews â†’ Needs Clarification
         â†“
AI Decision: Does this require NPA changes?
         â”œâ”€ YES â†’ Loop-Back to Maker
         â””â”€ NO â†’ Direct response to Approver (no loop-back)
AI Innovation: The Loop-Back Handler Agent intelligently determines whether clarification requires NPA modification or can be answered directly, saving unnecessary loops.
Scenario 3: Launch Preparation Issues


Preparing for Launch â†’ System config fails â†’ Legal review needed again
                       â†“
       Loop-Back to Sign-Off Stage (Legal only)
                       â†“
       Legal Approves â†’ Resume Launch Prep
Scenario 4: Post-Launch Corrective Action


Launched â†’ PIR identifies issue â†’ Requires NPA amendment
           â†“
   Loop-Back to Review Stage (expedited re-approval)
           â†“
   Approved â†’ Re-launched with fixes
Loop-Back Prevention Strategy:
1. Proactive Flagging: AI agents flag potential issues early (before Checker review)
2. Auto-Completeness Checks: Missing Field Detector catches gaps at ingestion
3. Predictive Clarifications: AI anticipates likely approver questions and pre-addresses them
4. Circuit Breaker: After 3 loop-backs, auto-escalate to COO management
Metrics Tracking:
* Loop-backs Today: 8
* Average Iterations: 1.4
* Time Added per Loop: +3-5 days
* Escalations Due to Excessive Loops: 1

12. Dual Decisioning Model: Rule-Based + Experiential
12.1 The Two Pillars of Decision Intelligence
The workbench implements a Dual Decisioning Model that combines:
1. Rule-Based Decisioning (Codified Knowledge)
2. Practice-Based/Experiential Decisioning (Learned Patterns)
This model is inspired by AgentFlow's approach and is critical for NPA approvals and Desk Support decisions.
12.2 Rule-Based Decisioning
Definition: Hard-coded business logic derived from policies, regulations, and explicit approval matrices.
Examples (NPA):
* "If notional value > $1M â†’ CFO approval required"
* "If counterparty credit rating < BBB â†’ Credit team escalation"
* "If product involves derivatives â†’ Legal review mandatory"
* "If capital utilization > 85% â†’ Capital optimization team consultation"
Implementation:
* Rule Engine: 23 core rules for NPA (stored in configuration database)
* Deterministic: Same input always produces same output
* Transparent: Always shows which rule was applied
* Maintainable: Business users can update rules via Configurations Module
Advantages:
* Consistent: No variation in decisions for same inputs
* Auditable: Clear reasoning traceable to specific rule
* Regulatory-Friendly: Easily demonstrates compliance to MAS auditors
Limitations:
* Brittle: Cannot handle edge cases not covered by rules
* Static: Does not learn from new cases
