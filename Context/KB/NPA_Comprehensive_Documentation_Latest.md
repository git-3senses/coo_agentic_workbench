## NPA Process Overview

The New Product Approval (NPA) process is a comprehensive risk assessment framework used by DBS Bank to evaluate and approve new products and services. The process ensures that all risks are identified, assessed, and mitigated before product launch.

### NPA Types

1. **New-to-Group**: Completely new products/services not previously offered by DBS
2. **Variation**: Modifications to existing products with different risk profiles
3. **Existing**: Extensions or reactivations of previously approved products
4. **NPA Lite**: Streamlined process for variations or existing products with minimal incremental risk

### Key Principles

- **Risk-Based Approach**: Comprehensive assessment of operational, market, credit, and reputational risks
- **Cross-Functional Review**: Sign-off required from multiple stakeholders
- **Documentation Standards**: Thorough documentation of all risk assessments and controls
