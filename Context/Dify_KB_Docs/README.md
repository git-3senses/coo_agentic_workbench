# Dify Knowledge Base Documents (POC)

These Markdown files are **POC / mock knowledge sources** intended to be uploaded into Dify datasets for agent grounding.

Conventions:
- Each doc declares a suggested dataset name in the header.
- Content is written to be **usable by agents** (clear rules, tables, and decision points).
- Where bank/regulator names are mentioned, treat them as **illustrative** unless you replace with your real references.
