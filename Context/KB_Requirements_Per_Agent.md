## Current KB Coverage Assessment

### What Exists Today
| KB Source | Coverage | Used By |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `NPA_Business_Process_Deep_Knowledge.md` | Full NPA lifecycle, 5 approval tracks, 7 SOPs, case studies, 140+ term glossary | ALL agents (foundation) |
| `KB_Classification_Criteria.md` | Product classification rules | CLASSIFIER agent |
| `KB_Product_Taxonomy.md` | Product categorization hierarchy | CLASSIFIER, BIZ |

### What's Missing
The existing KBs provide **process knowledge** (how the NPA works) and **template structure** (what fields exist), but they lack **domain-depth content** — the actual regulatory text, policy documents, calculation methodologies, and real-world examples each agent needs to generate substantive, accurate field values.
