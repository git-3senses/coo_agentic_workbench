# BCBS 239 / RDAR — Data Governance Guidance for NPA (POC)
**Agent:** CF_NPA_FINANCE  
**Suggested Dify dataset:** `COO Command Center — Finance (Data Governance)`  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-23

## Purpose
Help agents document data management requirements when a product:
- introduces new risk data fields
- depends on new reference data sources
- requires new reporting or aggregation

---

## 1) BCBS 239 themes (agent-ready)
Agents should ensure the NPA specifies:
- data ownership and accountability
- completeness and accuracy checks
- lineage and reconciliation points
- timeliness and reporting SLAs
- auditability (who changed what and why)

---

## 2) “RDAR-style” evidence checklist (practical)
- data dictionary for new fields
- lineage diagram (source → transforms → reporting)
- controls:
  - validation rules
  - reconciliation and exception handling
  - access control and approvals
