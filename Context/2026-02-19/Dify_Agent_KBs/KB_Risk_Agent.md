# Knowledge Base: Prohibited List Checker Agent (Risk & Policy Agent)

**Updated: 2026-02-19 | Cross-verified against NPA_Business_Process_Deep_Knowledge.md**

## System Identity & Prime Directive

**Agent Name**: Prohibited List Checker Agent ("The Compliance Gatekeeper")
**Role**: Real-time validation against prohibited products, jurisdictions, counterparties, and activities
**Primary Goal**: Detect non-compliance, prohibited activities, and high-risk indicators before any NPA processing begins, operating as a HARD STOP gate

**Prime Directive**:
**Zero False Negatives** - It is better to flag a safe product as "Needs Review" than to let a dangerous product pass as "Safe"

**Critical Design Philosophy**:
- **Conservative Failure Mode**: When in doubt, BLOCK and escalate to human review
- **Multi-Layer Defense**: 4 sequential checks (Internal Policy → Regulatory → Sanctions → Dynamic)
- **Real-Time Accuracy**: Daily OFAC updates, continuous monitoring of in-flight NPAs
- **Clear Communication**: Don't just say "NO" - explain why, suggest alternatives, guide to compliant solutions
- **Audit Trail**: 100% of checks logged, 7-year retention, immutable cryptographic hash

**Analogy**: This agent is like airport security screening - the first checkpoint that stops anything dangerous from entering the system, operating 24/7 with zero tolerance for violations.

## MCP Tools Reference

The following MCP tools are available for this agent's operations:

### Risk Assessment Tools
- **`risk_run_assessment`** - Execute full risk assessment against all four compliance layers for a given product/counterparty/jurisdiction combination
- **`risk_get_market_factors`** - Retrieve current market risk factors (volatility, liquidity, concentration) relevant to the product under review
- **`risk_add_market_factor`** - Add or update a market risk factor in the risk factor database (e.g., new volatility regime, emerging market stress indicator)
- **`risk_get_external_parties`** - Query external party databases (OFAC SDN, sanctions lists, counterparty registries) for entity verification

### Prerequisite & Validation Tools
- **`get_prerequisite_categories`** - Retrieve the list of prerequisite categories required for a given NPA classification (e.g., Legal, Compliance, Operations, Technology)
- **`validate_prerequisites`** - Validate whether all prerequisite sign-offs and documents are in place before allowing workflow progression

### State & Form Tools
- **`save_risk_check_result`** - Persist the results of a risk check to the NPA record for audit trail and downstream agent consumption
- **`get_form_field_value`** - Read current form field values from the NPA submission to extract product details, counterparty info, and jurisdiction data

### Gap Detection Tools
- **`detect_approximate_booking`** **(GAP-020)** - Detect cases where approximate or placeholder booking models are being used instead of exact booking, flagging for additional review. GAP-020 specifically targets scenarios where booking entity/location approximations may mask regulatory or tax implications.

## The Challenge This Agent Solves

### The Stakes

Banks face severe penalties for trading prohibited products or dealing with sanctioned entities:
- **Regulatory fines**: $100M+ for sanctions violations (OFAC, UN, EU)
- **Reputational damage**: Front-page news, loss of client trust
- **License revocation**: Worst case, loss of banking license
- **Criminal liability**: Individual executives can face prosecution

### The Risk Scenario

A well-intentioned Maker submits an NPA for what seems like a standard product, but:
- The counterparty is on OFAC sanctions list (they didn't know)
- The product involves Iran (sanctioned jurisdiction)
- The product type is banned by MAS regulation (policy changed last month)
- The distribution channel violates internal compliance policy

### Current Reality (Manual Compliance Checks)

**Timeline of Failure:**
1. **Maker submits NPA** → Sits in queue for 2-3 days
2. **Checker reviews** → Flags for Compliance review
3. **Compliance team checks** (1-2 days manual review)
4. **Discovers violation** → REJECT + escalation

**Total Timeline**: 4-5 days wasted on prohibited product

**The Damage:**
- Maker wasted 4-5 days of work
- Checker wasted review time
- Compliance team wasted research time
- Business opportunity lost (client went to competitor)
- Morale impact (Maker frustrated by late rejection)

### Current Pain Points Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Average processing time | 12 days | 4 days |
| First-time approval rate | 52% | 75% |
| Average rework iterations | 1.4 | 1.2 |
| Loop-backs per month | 8 | 5 |
| Circuit breaker escalations | ~1/month | — |

These metrics highlight the urgency for automated compliance gating: the current 12-day average processing time is 3x the target, and only 52% of NPAs pass on first submission. Rework iterations averaging 1.4 per NPA and 8 loop-backs per month represent significant operational drag that early-stage risk detection can mitigate.

### The Solution: Instant Compliance Validation

The Prohibited List Checker Agent solves this by:
1. **Instant validation** (<1 second vs 4-5 days)
2. **HARD STOP at submission** (blocks workflow immediately)
3. **Clear reasoning** (explains exactly why prohibited)
4. **Multi-layer checking** (internal policy + regulatory + sanctions + dynamic)
5. **Auto-updates** (new prohibitions sync daily)

**Result**: Zero prohibited products enter the approval workflow (100% prevention)

---

## Core Functionality: The Four-Layer Check

The agent performs four sequential checks, each operating as a HARD STOP gate. If **ANY** layer fails, return `status: BLOCKED`.

---

### Layer 1: Internal Bank Policy (DBS Prohibited List)

**What This Checks**: Products/activities that DBS has decided not to offer, regardless of legality

#### Why Banks Have Internal Prohibitions

- **Risk appetite**: Product too risky for bank's tolerance (e.g., cryptocurrency derivatives)
- **Reputational risk**: Legal but controversial (e.g., payday loans, tobacco financing)
- **Strategic decision**: Exiting certain business lines (e.g., coal mining financing)
- **Capacity constraints**: Lack of expertise/infrastructure (e.g., complex structured credit)

#### Example Internal Prohibitions at DBS

**Category 1: Cryptocurrency Products**
- All derivatives with cryptocurrency underlying (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)
- Reason: Extreme volatility risk, regulatory uncertainty
- Effective Date: 2023-01-15
- Policy Owner: Group Risk Management
- Policy Reference: RMG Policy 2023-001

**Category 2: Controversial Sectors**
- Payday loans (reputational risk)
- Thermal coal mining financing (ESG policy)
- Defense/Weapons financing (ethical policy)
- Adult industry counterparties (reputational risk)

**Category 3: Complex Products**
- Products with embedded CDS on sovereign debt (complexity)
- Speculative real estate in certain countries (credit risk)

#### Check Process Example

**Input**: Product description from Product Ideation Agent
```json
{
  "product": "Bitcoin Option",
  "underlying": "Bitcoin/USD",
  "structure": "European call option",
  "notional": "$10M"
}
```

**Agent Action**:
```
Step 1: Extract key terms
- Product type: "Option"
- Underlying: "Bitcoin"
- Asset class: "Cryptocurrency"

Step 2: Check Internal Prohibited List
Query: "Cryptocurrency" in prohibited_list
Result: MATCH FOUND

Prohibited Entry:
- Category: Cryptocurrency Derivatives
- Type: All derivatives with crypto underlying
- Reason: Extreme volatility risk, regulatory uncertainty
- Effective Date: 2023-01-15
- Policy Owner: Group Risk Management
- Policy Reference: RMG Policy 2023-001

Decision: PROHIBITED
```

**Output to User**:
```
❌ HARD STOP - Internal Policy Violation

Product: Bitcoin Option
Status: PROHIBITED

Reason:
This product involves cryptocurrency derivatives, which are prohibited under DBS internal risk policy.

Policy Details:
- Category: Cryptocurrency Derivatives
- Policy Reference: RMG Policy 2023-001
- Effective Date: 2023-01-15
- Policy Owner: Group Risk Management

Why Prohibited:
DBS has determined that cryptocurrency derivatives carry unacceptable volatility risk and regulatory uncertainty. All derivative products with cryptocurrency underlying assets are prohibited regardless of structure or client type.

Alternative Products:
Consider these approved alternatives:
• FX Options on major currency pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, JPY/USD)
• Commodity options on gold, silver, oil (regulated exchanges only)
• Equity options on major indices (S&P 500, FTSE 100, Hang Seng)

Next Steps:
If you believe this is an error or have a compelling business case:
1. Contact Group Risk Management: risk-management@dbs.com
2. Request policy exception review (requires EVP approval)
3. Expected review time: 2-4 weeks

Note: Workflow has been HALTED. This NPA cannot proceed without policy exception approval.
```

**Workflow State**:
```
Status: TERMINATED (PROHIBITED)
Reason: Internal Policy Violation
Next Stage: None (HARD STOP)
Escalation: None (unless Maker requests exception review)
```

**Key Point**: The NPA **cannot proceed** unless Maker gets EVP-level exception approval (rare).

---

### Layer 2: Regulatory Restrictions (MAS, CFTC, Local Regulations)

**What This Checks**: Products/activities banned by financial regulators

#### Regulatory Bodies

- **MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore)**: Primary regulator for Singapore operations
- **CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission)**: US derivatives regulator
- **FCA (Financial Conduct Authority)**: UK regulator (for London desk)
- **HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority)**: Hong Kong regulator
- **Local regulators**: Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia, etc.

#### Example Regulatory Restrictions

**MAS Restriction 1: Binary Options Retail Distribution**
- Regulation: MAS Notice SFA04-N12 (Amendment 2016)
- Restriction: Binary options prohibited for retail distribution
- Effective Date: 2016-09-01
- Penalty: Up to $1M SGD fine + criminal liability

**CFTC Restriction 2: Event Contracts**
- Regulation: CFTC ban on event contracts on political outcomes
- Effective Date: 2012
- Scope: All contracts with political event underlying

**EU Restriction 3: Binary Options Marketing**
- Regulation: ESMA 2018 binary options marketing restriction
- Scope: Prohibits marketing binary options to retail clients in EU
- Effective Date: 2018-07-02

**China Restriction 4: Cross-Border Derivatives**
- Regulation: SAFE cross-border derivatives restrictions
- Scope: Limits on Chinese entities trading offshore derivatives

#### Check Process Example

**Input**: Product description + target market
```json
{
  "product": "Binary Option on Gold",
  "structure": "All-or-nothing payout",
  "client_type": "Retail",
  "location": "Singapore"
}
```

**Agent Action**:
```
Step 1: Extract regulatory trigger terms
- Product type: "Binary Option"
- Client segment: "Retail"
- Jurisdiction: "Singapore"

Step 2: Check MAS Regulations
Query: "Binary Option" + "Retail" + "Singapore"
Result: MATCH FOUND

Regulatory Entry:
- Regulation: MAS Notice SFA04-N12 (Amendment 2016)
- Restriction: Binary options prohibited for retail distribution
- Scope: All binary options to retail clients in Singapore
- Effective Date: 2016-09-01
- Penalty: Up to $1M fine + criminal liability

Decision: PROHIBITED (Regulatory Violation)
```

**Output to User**:
```
❌ HARD STOP - Regulatory Violation

Product: Binary Option on Gold
Status: PROHIBITED

Reason:
This product violates MAS regulations prohibiting binary options distribution to retail clients in Singapore.

Regulatory Details:
- Regulation: MAS Notice SFA04-N12 (Amendment 2016)
- Effective Date: 2016-09-01
- Jurisdiction: Singapore
- Violation Type: Prohibited product-client combination

Why Prohibited:
MAS banned binary options for retail clients due to:
• High risk of total loss (all-or-nothing payout)
• Prevalence of mis-selling and fraud
• Lack of consumer understanding
• Speculative nature unsuitable for retail investors

Penalties for Violation:
• Monetary penalty: Up to $1M SGD
• Criminal liability: Possible prosecution of executives
• Regulatory action: License suspension/revocation
• Reputational damage: Public enforcement action

Alternative Products:
If targeting retail clients:
• Plain-vanilla FX Options (approved for retail)
• Structured deposits with capital protection
• Equity-linked notes (with MAS approval)

If targeting institutional/accredited investors:
• Binary options ARE permitted for institutional clients
• Reclassify client segment to "Institutional" and resubmit

Next Steps:
1. Verify client classification (Retail vs Institutional)
2. If retail: Choose alternative product
3. If institutional: Update NPA with correct client segment

Note: This is a HARD STOP. DBS cannot proceed with regulatory violations regardless of business case.
```

**Key Difference from Internal Policy**:
- **Internal policy**: Bank can grant exceptions (EVP approval)
- **Regulatory restriction**: **No exceptions possible** (external law)

---

### Layer 3: Sanctions & Embargoes (OFAC, UN, EU)

**What This Checks**: Transactions involving sanctioned countries, entities, or individuals

#### Sanctions Bodies

- **OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control)**: US Treasury Department
- **UN Security Council**: Global sanctions (all member states must comply)
- **EU**: European Union sanctions
- **Local sanctions**: Singapore, Hong Kong, UK individual sanctions lists

#### Types of Sanctions

**1. Country Sanctions** (Comprehensive bans)
- North Korea: Complete trade ban
- Iran: Comprehensive sanctions (limited humanitarian exceptions)
- Syria: Comprehensive sanctions (EU + US)
- Cuba: US trade embargo (limited exceptions)
- Crimea region: EU + US sanctions

**2. Sectoral Sanctions** (Specific industries)
- Russian energy sector: Debt maturity restrictions
- Myanmar military entities: Targeted sanctions
- Venezuelan state-owned entities: Debt + equity restrictions

**3. Entity Sanctions** (Specific companies)
- Huawei sub-entities: US Entity List
- ZTE: Sanctions compliance violations
- Russian banks: Swift exclusion + asset freezes

**4. Individual Sanctions** (Specific people)
- SDN List (Specially Designated Nationals): 10,000+ individuals
- Asset freeze + transaction prohibition
- Travel bans (immigration sanctions)

#### Check Process Example

**Input**: Product description + counterparty + jurisdiction
```json
{
  "product": "FX Forward USD/RUB",
  "counterparty": "Russian Energy Bank",
  "structure": "Standard FX forward",
  "notional": "$50M",
  "tenor": "90 days",
  "settlement": "Moscow"
}
```

**Agent Action**:
```
Step 1: Extract sanctions trigger terms
- Currency: "RUB" (Russian Ruble)
- Counterparty: "Russian Energy Bank"
- Settlement location: "Moscow"
- Sector: Energy (implied from counterparty name)

Step 2: Check OFAC SDN List
Query: "Russian Energy Bank"
Result: MATCH FOUND

Sanctions Entry:
- Entity: Russian Energy Bank (REBank)
- SDN List ID: 12345
- Sanction Type: Sectoral (energy sector)
- Effective Date: 2022-03-01
- Authority: Executive Order 14024 (Ukraine-related sanctions)
- Scope: Prohibition on new debt >14 days maturity

Step 3: Cross-Check Transaction Type
Transaction: FX Forward (90-day tenor)
Comparison: 90 days > 14 days threshold
Result: PROHIBITED (Exceeds maturity limit)

Decision: PROHIBITED (Sanctions Violation)
```

**Output to User**:
```
🚨 HARD STOP - SANCTIONS VIOLATION

Product: FX Forward USD/RUB
Counterparty: Russian Energy Bank
Status: PROHIBITED

Reason:
The counterparty is on the OFAC Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list with restrictions on transactions exceeding 14 days maturity.

Sanctions Details:
- Entity: Russian Energy Bank (REBank)
- SDN List ID: 12345
- Sanction Authority: U.S. Executive Order 14024
- Sanction Type: Sectoral (energy sector)
- Effective Date: 2022-03-01
- Prohibition: New debt >14 days maturity

Your Transaction:
- Type: FX Forward
- Tenor: 90 days
- Maturity Threshold: 14 days
- Violation: 90 days > 14 days (EXCEEDS LIMIT)

Why This Is Critical:
• Criminal offense under U.S. law (potential $10M+ fine per violation)
• Asset freeze risk (U.S. can freeze DBS assets in USD clearing)
• Correspondent banking risk (U.S. banks may terminate relationships)
• Criminal liability for executives involved
• Reputational damage (DOJ prosecution, media coverage)

NO EXCEPTIONS:
Sanctions violations have zero tolerance. This transaction CANNOT proceed under any circumstances.

Alternative Options:
NONE - Recommend declining client request

If Client Insists:
Explain: "DBS cannot facilitate this transaction due to international sanctions. Proceeding would expose both DBS and the client to severe legal and financial penalties."

Compliance Escalation:
This attempted transaction has been automatically reported to:
• DBS Compliance Team (compliance@dbs.com)
• Group Financial Crime Compliance
• Sanctions Monitoring Unit

Note: All sanctions checks are logged for regulatory audit. Do NOT attempt to circumvent sanctions through alternative structures.
```

**Automatic Actions**:
```
1. HARD STOP: Workflow terminated
2. Compliance Alert: Email sent to sanctions monitoring team
3. Audit Log: Permanent record of attempted prohibited transaction
4. User Flag: Maker receives compliance training reminder
5. Manager Notification: Maker's manager notified of sanctions check failure
```

**This is the most serious prohibition** - sanctions violations can result in criminal prosecution.

### Layer 4: Dynamic Compliance Rules (Real-Time Policy Updates)

**What This Checks**: Recently updated policies that may not yet be in static lists

#### Why Dynamic Checks Matter

Compliance landscapes change rapidly:
- **New sanctions imposed**: Russia sanctions added weekly in 2022
- **Regulatory emergency actions**: COVID-19 emergency rules
- **Internal policy changes**: ESG exclusions added
- **Breaking news**: Company suddenly under investigation (e.g., SVB failure)

**Static lists risk being outdated.** Dynamic checks query live databases.

#### Check Process Example

**Input**: Product + counterparty + current date
```json
{
  "product": "Corporate Bond",
  "issuer": "Silicon Valley Bank",
  "issue_date": "2025-12-26",
  "client": "Institutional investor"
}
```

**Agent Action**:
```
Step 1: Check Static Prohibited List
Query: "Silicon Valley Bank"
Result: NO MATCH (not on prohibited list as of last update)

Step 2: Check Dynamic Compliance Database (Real-Time API Call)
API Call: GET /compliance/real-time-check
Parameters: {
  entity: "Silicon Valley Bank",
  check_date: "2025-12-26",
  check_type: "financial_health"
}

API Response:
{
  "entity": "Silicon Valley Bank",
  "status": "FAILED_INSTITUTION",
  "event_date": "2023-03-10",
  "event_type": "FDIC Receivership",
  "regulatory_action": "Ceased Operations",
  "recommendation": "DO_NOT_TRADE"
}

Step 3: Apply Dynamic Rule
Rule: Institutions in receivership → PROHIBITED
Decision: PROHIBITED (Failed Institution)
```

**Output to User**:
```
⚠️ HARD STOP - Failed Institution

Product: Silicon Valley Bank Corporate Bond
Status: PROHIBITED

Reason:
Silicon Valley Bank is currently in FDIC receivership following its failure on March 10, 2023. DBS policy prohibits trading securities of failed institutions.

Regulatory Status:
- Event: FDIC Receivership
- Event Date: 2023-03-10
- Current Status: Ceased Operations
- Regulator: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)

Why Prohibited:
• Institution has failed and is no longer operating
• Bond may have zero recovery value
• Regulatory uncertainty around claims process
• Reputational risk of trading failed bank securities
• Fiduciary duty to protect clients from worthless securities

This check is performed in REAL-TIME against current regulatory databases to capture events that occurred after our last static list update.

Alternative Products:
If client seeks bank bonds, consider:
• Investment-grade bank bonds (rated A or above)
• Systemically important banks (G-SIBs)
• Covered bonds with collateral protection

Next Steps:
Inform client that DBS cannot facilitate this trade due to issuer failure.

Last Checked: 2025-12-26 09:00:00 SGT (Real-Time)

### Layer 5: Finance & Tax Specific Validation (Business Rule Requirement)

**What This Checks**: Accounting treatment and Cross-Border Tax implications (per Section IV.A.2 of NPA Rules).

**Critical Checks**:
1. **Classification Mismatch**: Warning if "Trading Book" product invokes "Banking Book" accounting (or vice versa).
2. **Tax Triggers**:
    *   **Withholding Tax**: Alert if counterparty jurisdiction (e.g., China, Indonesia) typically applies WHT on this product type.
    *   **Transfer Pricing**: Alert if booking entity differs from risk-taking entity (Cross-Border).
3. **Accounting Standards**:
    *   Prompt validation for **FVPL** (Fair Value Through Profit/Loss), **FVOCI** (Fair Value through OCI), or **Amortised Cost**.

**Example**:
```
Input: "Hold-to-Maturity Bond in Trading Book"
Check: HTM is typically Banking Book (Amortised Cost). Trading Book requires Fair Value.
Flag: POTENTIAL MISCLASSIFICATION (Finance Risk)
Action: Require Finance Sign-Off confirmation.
```

#### Extended Finance & Tax Layer Details (Cross-Verified from Deep Knowledge)

The following additional considerations apply within Layer 5 and must be validated for any cross-border or multi-jurisdiction NPA:

**Withholding Tax Considerations for Cross-Border Products**:
- Cross-border NPAs must be screened for withholding tax (WHT) applicability in the counterparty's jurisdiction.
- Example: Chinese withholding tax and VAT were key considerations in the NAFMII Repo Agreement (TSG2042). CNY/CNH restricted currency handling introduced additional WHT complexity.
- Jurisdictions with common WHT triggers include China, Indonesia, India, and South Korea.
- When in doubt, the agent should flag for Finance/Tax review before proceeding.

**Transfer Pricing Implications for Cross-Border Booking**:
- If the booking entity is in a different jurisdiction from the risk-taking entity, transfer pricing documentation and arm's-length pricing validation are required.
- Cross-border booking arrangements must be reviewed for compliance with OECD transfer pricing guidelines and local tax authority requirements.

**Dual Booking Requirements**:
- Certain products may require dual booking (e.g., one booking in the originating entity and a mirror booking in the risk-managing entity).
- The agent should detect dual booking scenarios and flag them for Operations and Finance review.

**Group Finance Consultation Rule**:
- Consult Group Finance when in doubt about accounting treatment changes, especially for new product types that do not have clear precedent in the existing accounting policy framework.
- Any change in accounting classification (e.g., from FVPL to Amortised Cost) for an existing product line requires Group Finance sign-off.

**Reference Case - NAFMII Repo Agreement (TSG2042)**:
- Product involved CNY/CNH restricted currency handling
- Chinese withholding tax applied to interest payments
- VAT implications on financial services in China
- New jurisdiction/legal framework required Full NPA regardless of the simplicity of the underlying repo instrument
- This case established the precedent that jurisdiction/legal novelty always escalates classification

## Loop-Back Types Reference (from Deep Knowledge Section 12)

Understanding loop-back types is critical for the Risk Agent because loop-backs represent rework cycles that increase processing time and cost. The Risk Agent's goal is to prevent loop-backs caused by compliance/risk issues by catching them at the gate.

### Type 1: Checker Rejection (Major Loop-Back)
- **Flow**: Maker submits → Checker reviews → REJECTS → Loop-back to Draft
- **Time Impact**: +3-5 days per iteration
- **Current Average**: 1.4 iterations per NPA
- **Risk Agent Relevance**: By performing instant compliance validation before submission, the Risk Agent prevents Checker rejections caused by prohibited products, sanctions issues, or regulatory violations. This directly reduces Type 1 loop-backs.

### Type 2: Approval Clarification (Smart Loop-Back)
- **Flow**: Approver requests clarification during sign-off stage
- **Decision Logic**:
  - If clarification requires NPA document changes → loop-back to Maker (full rework cycle)
  - If answerable from existing documents → direct response from Maker (no loop-back to Draft)
- **Time Saved**: ~2-3 days when smart routing avoids full loop-back
- **Risk Agent Relevance**: Clear risk assessment output with detailed reasoning reduces the need for approvers to request clarification on risk/compliance matters.

### Type 3: Launch Preparation Issues
- **Flow**: During system configuration/UAT → issue discovered → loop-back to Sign-Off Stage (specific SOP only)
- **Typical Causes**:
  - System compatibility issues
  - Regulatory changes between approval and launch
  - Risk threshold breaches identified during UAT
- **Risk Agent Relevance**: The agent's continuous monitoring (Layer 4 dynamic checks) can detect regulatory changes that occur between approval and launch, triggering early alerts before UAT begins.

### Type 4: Post-Launch Corrective Action
- **Flow**: After launch → PIR (Post-Implementation Review) identifies issue → loop-back to Review Stage (expedited)
- **Typical Causes**:
  - Volume below projections
  - Unexpected operational issues
  - Regulatory findings post-launch
- **Risk Agent Relevance**: Post-launch monitoring and PIR risk assessments feed back into the Risk Agent's dynamic compliance database, ensuring future NPAs benefit from lessons learned.

---

## Real NPA Examples & Lessons Learned (from Deep Knowledge Section 14)

The following real NPA cases provide critical precedent for risk assessment decisions. The Risk Agent should reference these patterns when evaluating new submissions.

### TSG1917: FX Options
- **Classification**: Lightest track (existing product, clear precedent)
- **Lesson**: When a product has clear precedent in the existing product library and the jurisdiction/counterparty/legal framework are unchanged, the lightest NPA track applies.
- **Risk Agent Implication**: Products matching existing FX Options patterns with no new risk factors can be fast-tracked through compliance checks.

### TSG2042: NAFMII Repo Agreement
- **Classification**: Full NPA (despite simple underlying instrument)
- **Key Factors**: New jurisdiction (China), new legal framework (NAFMII master agreement), CNY/CNH restricted currency handling, Chinese withholding tax, VAT
- **Lesson**: A new jurisdiction or legal framework ALWAYS triggers Full NPA classification, regardless of how simple the underlying product is.
- **Risk Agent Implication**: The agent must detect jurisdiction novelty and legal framework changes as independent risk escalation triggers. A "simple repo" becomes a Full NPA when the legal wrapper or jurisdiction is new.

### TSG2055: ETF Subscription
- **Classification**: Required deal-specific approval
- **Lesson**: Some products require deal-specific approval even when the product type itself has precedent. ETF subscriptions may involve specific fund structures, distribution channel restrictions, or regulatory requirements that vary by deal.
- **Risk Agent Implication**: The agent should flag products where deal-specific characteristics (fund structure, distribution channel) may override general product-level approvals.

### TSG2339: Swap Connect
- **Classification**: Full NPA (infrastructure/market access change)
- **Lesson**: Infrastructure or market access changes that fundamentally alter the operational model require Full NPA treatment. Swap Connect introduced a new way to access China's interbank bond market, changing clearing, settlement, and operational workflows.
- **Risk Agent Implication**: Market infrastructure changes (new clearing houses, new access schemes, new settlement mechanisms) should be treated as operational model changes and escalated accordingly.

### TSG2543: Multi-Asset Product
- **Classification**: Multiple SOP reviews required, longest timelines
- **Lesson**: Multi-asset products trigger reviews across multiple SOPs (one per asset class), resulting in the longest approval timelines. Each asset class component must pass its own compliance and risk checks independently.
- **Risk Agent Implication**: The agent must decompose multi-asset products into their constituent asset classes and run independent compliance checks for each. A failure in any single asset class component blocks the entire product.

---

## Risk Tiering Logic

For products that PASS all 4 compliance layers, assign a `Risk_Tier` to determine approval requirements:

### Tier 1: Critical Risk
**Trigger Conditions**:
- Notional > $500M **OR**
- Keyword: "New Asset Class" (never offered before) **OR**
- Complexity Score > 90/100

**Approval Requirements**:
- Sequential Board-level sign-off
- Group CEO approval
- Group CRO approval
- Group CFO approval

**Expected Timeline**: 3-4 weeks

**Example**:
```

## How the Agent Stays Updated

**Challenge**: Sanctions lists update daily, regulations change monthly, internal policies evolve quarterly.

**Solution**: Multi-source synchronization

### Update Source 1: OFAC SDN List (Daily)

```
Schedule: Daily at 03:00 SGT
Process:
1. Download OFAC SDN list (XML format)
2. Parse 10,000+ sanctioned entities
3. Update Redis cache
4. Compare to previous day (detect new additions)
5. Alert Compliance team: "12 new entities added to SDN list today"
6. Agent uses updated list for next check

Last Update: 2025-12-26 03:00:00 SGT
Next Update: 2025-12-27 03:00:00 SGT
Entities in Cache: 10,247
```

### Update Source 2: MAS Regulations (Weekly)

```
Schedule: Weekly on Monday 02:00 SGT
Process:
1. Scrape MAS public notices and circulars
2. Parse regulatory changes
3. Update compliance rule engine
4. Human review: Compliance Officer reviews changes
5. Approve updates (manual gate to prevent false positives)
6. Deploy to production

Last Update: 2025-12-23 (Week 51)
Next Update: 2025-12-30 (Week 52)
Rules in Database: 247 MAS regulations
```

### Update Source 3: Internal Policy (Monthly)

```
Schedule: Monthly on 1st day at 06:00 SGT
Process:
1. Compliance Officer submits policy changes via admin panel
2. Risk Management approves
3. GFM COO signs off
4. Deploy to prohibited list
5. Notify all users: "Internal prohibited list updated - 3 new restrictions added"

Last Update: 2025-12-01
Next Update: 2026-01-01
Prohibited Categories: 23
Prohibited Entities: 156
```

### Update Source 4: Real-Time APIs (Continuous)

```
Frequency: Real-time (every check)
Sources:
- Bloomberg Regulatory Feed
- FDIC Public Database
- News aggregators (for breaking events)
- SEC enforcement actions

Cache TTL: 15 minutes (balance freshness vs performance)
```

---

## Performance Targets & Metrics

### Target 1: Speed
- **Check time**: <1 second (target: 800ms average)
- **Layer 1 (Internal)**: 100ms (Redis cache lookup)
- **Layer 2 (Regulatory)**: 200ms (SQL query)
- **Layer 3 (Sanctions)**: 300ms (OFAC API + Redis cache)
- **Layer 4 (Dynamic)**: 200ms (REST API call with 15-min cache)

### Target 2: Accuracy
- **False positive rate**: <2% (blocks allowed transaction)
- **False negative rate**: 0% (allows prohibited transaction - ZERO TOLERANCE)
- **Match accuracy**: >99.8% (correctly identifies prohibited items)

### Target 3: Uptime
- **Availability**: 99.9% (critical compliance function)
- **Failover**: If primary check fails, secondary manual review triggered
- **Fallback**: If agent down, workflow halts (conservative failure mode)

### Target 4: Audit
- **All checks logged**: 100% (regulatory requirement)
- **Log retention**: 7 years (compliance requirement)
- **Audit trail**: Immutable (cryptographic hash)

---

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Edge Case 1: Partial Name Match

**Scenario**: Counterparty name is similar to sanctioned entity but not exact match

**Example**:
- Sanctioned entity: "Bank of Tehran"
- User input: "Bank of Tehran International"

**Challenge**: Is this the same entity (sanctions evasion) or different entity (legitimate)?

**Agent Handling**:
```
Step 1: Fuzzy Matching
- Exact match: NO
- Fuzzy match (85% similarity): YES

Step 2: Conservative Decision
- Treat as potential match → FLAG for manual review
- Do NOT auto-approve (risk of sanctions violation)
- Do NOT auto-reject (risk of false positive blocking legitimate business)

Step 3: Manual Review Queue
Output to User:
"⚠️ Potential Sanctions Match Detected

Counterparty: Bank of Tehran International
Similar Entity: Bank of Tehran (OFAC SDN List)
Similarity: 85%

This requires manual Compliance review before proceeding.

Your NPA has been routed to:
• Sanctions Monitoring Unit
• Expected Review Time: 4-6 hours

Status: PENDING (awaiting Compliance clearance)

Next Steps:
- Compliance will research entity relationship
- If different entity: Workflow resumes
- If same entity: Workflow terminated

Do NOT proceed until Compliance clearance received."
```

**Human Compliance Officer Reviews**:
- Searches Bloomberg, LinkedIn, company registries
- Determines: "Bank of Tehran International" is a subsidiary of "Bank of Tehran"
- Decision: **REJECT** (sanctions evasion attempt)

---

### Edge Case 2: Sanctions Imposed Mid-Workflow

**Scenario**: NPA submitted, approved, in launch preparation. Then sanctions imposed on counterparty.

**Agent Handling**:
```
Real-Time Monitoring:
- Agent checks OFAC daily updates at 03:00 SGT
- Detects: "New Entity Added: XYZ Corporation"

Cross-Check Against In-Flight NPAs:
- Query: All NPAs with status != "Launched" OR "Closed"
- Find: NPA TSG2025-042 involves XYZ Corporation
- Status: Preparing for Launch (1 day from go-live)

Automatic Action:
1. HALT workflow immediately
2. Escalate to Compliance + GFM COO
3. Notify all stakeholders

Escalation Message:
"🚨 URGENT - Sanctions Imposed on In-Flight NPA

NPA: TSG2025-042
Counterparty: XYZ Corporation
Status: HALTED (was in Preparing for Launch)

Event:
OFAC added XYZ Corporation to SDN list as of 2025-12-26 03:00 SGT

Impact:
This NPA can NO LONGER proceed. Sanctions prohibit all transactions with XYZ Corporation.

Immediate Actions Required:
1. Cancel launch preparation
2. Notify client: DBS cannot proceed due to sanctions
3. Review existing trades with XYZ Corporation for wind-down requirements
4. Legal review: Assess sanctions compliance for in-flight deals

Escalated To:
- GFM COO Office
- Group Compliance (Sanctions Monitoring)
- Legal Department
- Client Relationship Manager

Timeline:
- Compliance review: Within 24 hours
- Client notification: Within 48 hours
- Wind-down plan (if applicable): Within 1 week"
```

**This demonstrates continuous monitoring** - agent doesn't just check once at submission.

---

### Edge Case 3: Country Name Ambiguity

**Scenario**: User says "Georgia" - could be Georgia (country, former Soviet Union) or Georgia (U.S. state)

**Agent Handling**:
```
Step 1: Detect Ambiguity
- User input: "Client is in Georgia"
- Ambiguous term detected: "Georgia" (multiple meanings)

Step 2: Request Clarification
Output to User:
"🔍 Clarification Needed

You mentioned 'Georgia' as the client location.

Please clarify which you mean:
1. Georgia (country, Caucasus region, former Soviet Union)
2. Georgia (U.S. state, United States of America)

This affects sanctions and regulatory checks.

Please select: [Country] [U.S. State]"

Step 3: User Selects "Country"
- Re-run sanctions check with "Georgia (country)"
- Check: Georgia (country) is NOT sanctioned
- Check: Regulatory requirements for Georgia operations
- Result: PASS
```

**This prevents false positives** from ambiguous terms.

## Integration with Other Agents

### Integration 1: Product Ideation Agent
**Trigger Point**: Immediately after user describes product
**Process**:
1. Product Ideation collects product description
2. Calls Prohibited List Checker
3. If PROHIBITED: Stops interview, displays error
4. If PASS: Continues interview

**Example**:
```
User: "I want to offer a Bitcoin derivative"
Ideation Agent: [Collects basic info]
Prohibited List Checker: [Runs 4-layer check]
Result: PROHIBITED (Layer 1 - Internal Policy)
Ideation Agent: [Displays error, halts interview]
```

---

### Integration 2: Classification Router Agent
**Trigger Point**: Before finalizing classification
**Process**:
1. Classification Router receives product classification
2. Calls Prohibited List Checker (defensive check)
3. If PROHIBITED: Overrides classification, HARD STOP
4. If PASS: Proceeds with classification

**Example**:
```
Classification: "NTG - Full NPA"
Prohibited List Checker: [Re-validates]
Result: PASS
Classification Router: [Proceeds with NTG Full NPA track]
```

---

### Integration 3: Approval Orchestration Agent
**Trigger Point**: Before sending to approvers
**Process**:
1. Approval Orchestration prepares to route NPA
2. Calls Prohibited List Checker (final defensive check)
3. If PROHIBITED (somehow got through): Escalate to Compliance
4. Log incident: "Prohibited product bypassed initial check - investigate"

**This is a defensive safety check** - should never trigger if earlier checks worked.

## Why This Agent Is Critical

The Prohibited List Checker Agent is the **compliance gatekeeper** that protects the entire organization.

### Without This Agent:
- ❌ Prohibited products enter workflow, wasting 4-5 days before rejection
- ❌ Risk of $100M+ fines for sanctions violations
- ❌ Criminal prosecution risk for executives
- ❌ License revocation risk for the bank
- ❌ Reputational damage from compliance failures
- ❌ Manual compliance checks create 2-3 day delays

### With This Agent:
- ✅ Instant validation (<1 second vs 4-5 days)
- ✅ Zero prohibited products enter workflow (100% prevention)
- ✅ Criminal liability protection (OFAC compliance)
- ✅ Daily sanctions updates (always current)
- ✅ Clear guidance (explains why prohibited, suggests alternatives)
- ✅ Continuous monitoring (detects sanctions imposed mid-workflow)

### Key Business Impact:
1. **Risk Elimination**: 0% prohibited products enter workflow (vs historical 2-3% error rate)
2. **Time Savings**: 4-5 days saved per prohibited product catch
3. **Compliance Cost Reduction**: 80% reduction in manual compliance review workload
4. **Criminal Liability Protection**: Zero sanctions violations (vs industry average 0.1% violation rate = $100M+ fines)
5. **Reputational Protection**: No front-page sanctions scandals

### The Real Magic:
**The agent doesn't just say "NO" - it explains why, suggests alternatives, and guides users to compliant solutions.**

Instead of a frustrating dead-end, it's a helpful redirect toward legitimate business opportunities.

**Example**:
```
Blocked: Bitcoin derivative
Alternative Suggested: Gold derivative (same hedging benefit, compliant)
User Action: Switches to gold derivative
Result: Compliant deal closed in 5 days (vs 0 days if Bitcoin deal attempted)
```

That's the power of intelligent compliance automation.
