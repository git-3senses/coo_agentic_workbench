## 1. Policy Overview & Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

**New Product Approval (NPA) Policy establishes:**
- Controls and governance for introducing new products/services across DBS Group
- Standards for changes to existing products/services
- Risk assessment and sign-off requirements

**Scope:**
- **Applicable to:** ALL Business Units (BUs), Support Units (SUs), branches, subsidiaries in ALL locations
- **Geographic:** Singapore, Hong Kong, London, India, and all other DBS locations
- **Product Types:** Financial products, services, initiatives (principal, agent, intermediary, advisor roles)

---

### 1.2 Policy Framework Hierarchy

NPA is governed by three layers. Where they conflict, the **stricter** requirement ALWAYS prevails:

| Priority | Document | Owner | Scope |
|----------|----------|-------|-------|
| 1 (Highest) | **New Product Approval Policy** | Group | Overarching group policy |
| 2 | **NPA Standard** (DBS_10_S_0012_GR) | RMG-OR | Detailed standard issued by Risk Management Group |
| 3 | **GFM NPA Standard Operating Procedures** | GFM COO | GFM-specific rules — STRICTER than group standard in several areas |

**Critical rule:** Where the GFM SOP and the Group Standard differ, the stricter requirement prevails.

---

### 1.3 Regulatory Primacy Rule

**If DBS policy differs from regulatory requirements:**
- **The STRICTER requirement prevails** (always more conservative)
- RMG-OR (Risk Management Group - Operational Risk) must be notified

**Examples:**
- MAS requires 30-day approval timeline, DBS policy requires 20 days → Use 20 days
- Local regulation allows 2-year validity, DBS allows 1 year → Use 1 year

---

## 2. Product Definitions & Classifications

### 2.1 What is a "New Product/Service"?

**Definition:**
Any product or service DBS Group intends to offer as principal, agent, intermediary, or advisor.

**Three Main Categories:**

---

### 2.1.1 New-to-Group (NTG) [R03, R11, R16]

**Definition:**
Product/service DBS Group has NEVER done before — in any entity, in any form, in any location.

**Criteria (ANY triggers NTG classification):**

**Category A: New Businesses/Products**
- New businesses, initiatives, products, financial instruments, services
- **Example:** Credit Default Swaps (CDS) - DBS has never traded CDS → NTG
- **Example:** Cryptocurrency derivatives - DBS has never offered crypto products → NTG

**Category B: New Roles**
- New roles within business/product group
- **Roles:** Origination, trading as principal, distribution, agency, custodian, operating an exchange, providing operations support
- **Example:** DBS distributes FX Options, but never traded as principal → NTG (huge risk shift)
- **Example:** First time acting as custodian for mutual funds → NTG

**Category C: New Channels/Segments/Markets**
- New distribution channels
- New customer segments
- New exchange memberships
- New markets/geographies
- **Example:** First mobile app distribution (previously only branch) → NTG
- **Example:** First retail offering (previously only institutional) → NTG
- **Example:** First Singapore Exchange (SGX) membership for futures → NTG
- **Example:** First product in Vietnam market → NTG

**NTG Mandatory Requirements:**
1. **PAC Approval REQUIRED** (Product Approval Committee) — BEFORE NPA submission [R16]
2. **Full NPA Process** (NEVER NPA Lite, NEVER Bundling) [R11]
3. **All 7 Sign-Off Parties** (Credit, Finance, Legal, MLR, Operations, Technology, RMG-OR) [R20]
4. **NTG from overseas:** Head Office function sign-offs required [R22]
5. **PIR Mandatory** (within 6 months of launch, even without conditions) [R30]
6. **Validity:** 1 year (extendable ONCE for +6 months with unanimous SOP consent + COO approval) [R27, R28]

---

### 2.1.2 Variation [R04]

**Definition:**
Modification to existing product/service that **alters risk profile** for customer and/or bank.

**Criteria (ANY triggers Variation classification):**

**Variation Type 1: Bundling/Combination**
- Bundling or combination of existing products
- Can be by one unit OR jointly with another unit
- **Example:** FX Option + Deposit → Dual Currency Deposit (DCD)

**Variation Type 2: Cross-Book Structures**
- Product structures crossing banking vs trading books
- **Example:** Banking book loan combined with trading book derivative

**Variation Type 3: Accounting Treatment Change**
- Features/structures potentially changing accounting treatment
- **Example:** Accrual accounting → Mark-to-market accounting
- **Action Required:** **Consult Group Finance when in doubt**

**Variation Type 4: Manual Workarounds**
- Products requiring significant offline/manual adjustments
- **Example:** System can't calculate, requires manual Excel calculations

**Variation Type 5: Sustainability Features**
- Products with sustainability focus, features, labels
- **Example:** "Green" deposits, "Green" bonds, "ESG" loans

**Variation Type 6: Advanced/Innovative Technology**
- Use of advanced/innovative technology for existing products
- New or significant changes to business operating model
- **Example:** Collaboration with fintech companies, blockchain-based settlement, AI/ML pricing

**Variation Type 7: New Communication Channels**
- New third-party hosted communication/media channels/platforms
- Channels not previously risk-assessed
- **Example:** Social media platforms (WeChat, WhatsApp) for marketing

**Variation Approval Track — Risk Severity Determines Track:**
- **High Risk** (accounting change, cross-book, fintech, manual workarounds) → **Full NPA**
- **Medium Risk** (minor bundling, adding settlement option) → **NPA Lite**
- **Low Risk** (typo correction, clarification) → **NPA Lite Addendum (B4)**

---

### 2.1.3 Existing [R05]

**Definition:**
Products/services already approved elsewhere in DBS, but new to specific context.

**Three Sub-Types:**

**Existing Type A: New to Location/Entity/Branch/Unit**
- Product approved and launched by another BU/SU/location/entity
- Same product, different location/entity
- **Example:** FX Forward approved in Singapore, now launching in Hong Kong

**Existing Type B: Dormant Products**
- Product previously approved but **no transactions in last 12 months** [R34]
- Considered dormant, requires reactivation
- **Dormancy tiers matter:**
  - Dormant <1 year → NPA Lite (simple reactivation)
  - Dormant 1-3 years → NPA Lite (standard reactivation) or Fast-Track B3
  - **Dormant ≥3 years → Escalate to GFM COO** (may need Full NPA)

**Existing Type C: Expired Products**
- Approved products not launched within validity period
- Validity expired, requires reactivation
- **If no variations** → NPA Lite - Reactivation
- **If variations exist** → Full NPA (treated as effectively NTG)

**Existing Product Routing Logic (Complete):**

| Existing Status | Condition | Route |
|----------------|-----------|-------|
| Active + Evergreen list | Within limits | Evergreen (trade same day) |
| Active + NOT Evergreen | — | NPA Lite - Reference Existing |
| Dormant <3yr | Meets fast-track criteria (5 checks) | B3 Fast-Track (48 hours) |
| Dormant <3yr | Variations detected | Standard NPA Lite |
| **Dormant ≥3yr** | — | **ESCALATE to GFM COO** (may need Full NPA) |
| Expired | No variations | NPA Lite - Reactivation |
| Expired | Variations detected | Full NPA (treated as NTG) |

---

### 2.1.4 Exclusions (NOT Considered New Products)

**The following are EXCLUDED from NPA definition:**

1. **Organizational Changes** — Change management initiatives (org structure, transfer of responsibilities), NO change to product
2. **System Changes** — New system implementations OR enhancements with NO change to product supported
3. **Process Re-Engineering** — Process changes NOT triggered by new product/variation
4. **New Legal Entities** — New operating/legal entities via incorporation or acquisition (separate governance)

---

## 3. Two-Stage Classification Model [R02]

**Classification is the single most important decision in the NPA process. It happens in TWO stages, and getting it wrong means the entire downstream process is wrong.**

---

### Stage 1: What IS This Product? (Ontology)

Determine the fundamental nature of the product:
- **New-to-Group (NTG)** — Never done before anywhere in DBS Group
- **Variation** — Modification that alters risk profile
- **Existing** — Already approved elsewhere, new context

**You CANNOT proceed to Stage 2 without completing Stage 1.**

---

### Stage 2: HOW Should We Approve It? (Workflow)

Based on Stage 1 classification + risk factors, determine the approval track:
- **Track A:** Full NPA (all NTG, high-risk variations, expired with variations)
- **Track B:** NPA Lite — with 4 sub-types (B1/B2/B3/B4)
- **Track C:** Bundling Approval (8-condition gate)
- **Track D:** Evergreen (auto-approved if within limits)
- **Track E:** Hard Stop / Prohibited (immediate termination)

**The approval track depends entirely on what the product is.**

---

## 4. Approval Tracks — Five Pathways [R11-R19]

### Track A: Full NPA — The Heavy Lifter

**When:** All NTG products [R11]. High-risk Variations. Expired products with variations. Significant regulatory implications.

**Process:** Discovery → Review (Maker/Checker) → Sign-Off (parallel, all SOPs) → Launch Prep (system config, UAT) → Launch → PIR/Monitoring

**All 7 sign-off parties required:** Credit, Finance, Legal & Compliance, MLR, Operations, Technology, RMG-OR (consultative)

**Timeline:** Currently averages 12 days. Target: 4 days.

**ENFORCEMENT [R11]:** NTG → ALWAYS Full NPA. No exceptions. DB constraint.

---

### Track B: NPA Lite — The Agile Track (4 Sub-Types) [R12-R15]

#### B1: Impending Deal (48-Hour Express) [R12]
- **Eligibility:**
  - Back-to-back deal with professional counterparty, OR
  - Dormant/expired product with UAT completed, OR
  - Singapore-approved NPA applicable regionally on BTB basis
- **Process:**
  - 48-hour notice period to ALL relevant SOPs
  - If **ANY** SOP objects → Falls back to standard NPA Lite
  - If no objections after 48 hours → **Auto-approved**
- **Timeline:** 48 hours

---

#### B2: NLNOC (NPA Lite No Objection Concurrence) [R13]
- **Eligibility:**
  - Simple change to payoff of approved product
  - Reactivation of dormant/expired NPA with no structural changes
- **Process:**
  - Decision by **GFM COO + Head of RMG-MLR jointly**
  - SOPs provide "no-objection concurrence" (lighter than full sign-off)
- **Timeline:** 5-10 business days

---

#### B3: Fast-Track Dormant Reactivation (48-Hour) [R14]
- **Eligibility — ALL 5 criteria must pass:**
  1. Existing live trade in the past (trade history confirmed)
  2. NOT on prohibited list (sanctions/regulatory clear)
  3. PIR completed for original NPA
  4. No variation or changes to product features
  5. No change to booking model/system
- **Process:**
  - 48-hour no-objection notice to original approvers
  - If no objections → Auto-approved
  - If ANY criterion fails → Route to standard NPA Lite
- **Timeline:** 48 hours

---

#### B4: Approved NPA Addendum (Minor Changes) [R15]
- **Eligibility:**
  - Applies to **LIVE** (not expired) NPAs only
  - Minor/incremental updates (adding cash settlement, bilateral → tripartite, typo fixes)
  - **NOT eligible** for new features, new payoffs, new risk profiles
- **Process:**
  - Original NPA reference kept intact (same GFM ID)
  - Reduced sign-off (typically 1-2 SOPs affected)
- **CRITICAL:** Validity period NOT extended (maintains original expiry)
- **Timeline:** <5 business days

---

### Track C: Bundling Approval — The LEGO Master [R08, R17]

Combining 2+ already-approved "building blocks" into a new structure. Requires 8-condition gate to pass (see Section 11).

---

### Track D: Evergreen — The Fast Pass [R09, R18, R43, R44]

Standard vanilla products "always on" for 3 years (see Section 21).

---

### Track E: Hard Stop — Prohibited [R01, R10]

**Products or jurisdictions explicitly banned by policy or regulation. IMMEDIATE workflow termination.**

**No exceptions without Compliance/EVP review.**

**Three Prohibition Layers:**
1. **Internal bank policy** — Products DBS has decided not to offer (risk appetite, reputational)
2. **Regulatory restrictions** — MAS, CFTC, FCA, local regulators
3. **Sanctions/embargoes** — OFAC SDN, UN Security Council, EU, MAS (zero tolerance, criminal liability)

**ENFORCEMENT [R01]:** Prohibited check runs BEFORE classification (Step 0). Hard stop = workflow termination.

**ENFORCEMENT [R10]:** If prohibited → NPA CANNOT be created. System must BLOCK all stage transitions. No workarounds.

---

## 5. NPA Lifecycle (5 Stages)

### Stage 1: Product Development & Business Case

**Activities:**

**Product Ideation:**
- Initial product concept development
- Identify market opportunity, customer need

**Early Engagement:**
- **CRITICAL:** Hold discussions with sign-off parties EARLY (before formal NPA)
- Purpose: Mutual understanding of product and key risks
- Incorporate sign-off party inputs BEFORE first draft
- **Benefit:** Reduces loop-backs, saves 3-5 days later

**Business Case Preparation:**
- Proposing unit prepares business case detailing:
  - Rationale (why this product?)
  - Costs (development, operations, technology)
  - Benefits (revenue, strategic positioning)
  - Key risks (credit, market, operational, reputational)
  - Mitigants (how risks will be managed)

**PAC Approval (NTG Products ONLY) [R16]:**
- **If NTG:** Proposing unit MUST submit to Product Approval Committee (PAC)
- **PAC Composition:** GFM COO, Group Risk Head, CFO, CRO
- **ONLY AFTER PAC approval** can NPA process begin
- **HARD GATE:** NPA submission BLOCKED if NTG and PAC ≠ Approved

---

### Stage 2: NPA Process (Due Diligence, Review, Sign-Off, Approval)

**Initiation:**
- Proposing unit assesses product classification (NTG/Variation/Existing)
- If in doubt → Engage Group BU/SU COO for classification decision
- Organize NPA kick-off meeting with sign-off parties
- If cross-border: Finance, Credit, MLR, Tech, Ops sign-offs MANDATORY [R07]

**Due Diligence:**
- Product specifications, risk assessment, operational requirements
- Technology requirements, data management, legal documentation

**Review & Sign-Off [R25-R26]:**
- Maker → Checker → SOPs → COO (sequential gates)
- Parallel SOP review (all sign-off parties review simultaneously)
- SOPs can set: permanent restrictions, product parameters, post-launch conditions [R23, R24]
- NTG from overseas: Head Office function sign-offs required [R22]
- Non-NTG core markets: Group SU Heads appoint location sign-off party
- Non-NTG international centres: Location or Head Office (Group SU Head's discretion)

**Approval:**
- Group BU/SU COO (or delegate) gives final approval
- For overseas-initiated: local approval FIRST, then Group COO approval

---

### Stage 3: Regulatory Clearance & UAT

- Separate from NPA process but can run **in parallel**
- Issues identified must be addressed BEFORE launch
- Re-approvals from relevant SOPs if needed
- Launch CANNOT occur until: ALL sign-offs + ALL regulatory clearances + ALL UAT issues resolved

---

### Stage 4: Launch

- **Launch = first marketed sale/offer OR first trade** (not just indication of interest)
- Must occur within validity period
- If not launched within validity → NPA expires [R27]

---

### Stage 5: Post-Implementation Review (PIR) [R30-R32]

- Mandatory for ALL NTG products (even without conditions)
- Mandatory for ALL products with post-launch conditions
- **GFM stricter rule:** Mandatory for ALL launched products regardless of type [R32]
- Must be initiated within 6 months of launch

---

## 6. Initiation & Kick-Off Requirements

### 6.1 Classification Assessment

**Before initiating NPA:**
- Proposing unit assesses product classification (NTG/Variation/Existing)
- **If uncertain:** Engage Group BU/SU COO for decision
- **GFM-Specific:** GFM COO consults GFM NPA Governance Forum

---

### 6.2 Cross-Border Mandatory Sign-Offs [R07]

**If NPA involves cross-border booking — NON-NEGOTIABLE:**
1. Finance (Group Product Control)
2. RMG-Credit
3. RMG-Market & Liquidity Risk (MLR)
4. Technology
5. Operations

**These 5 SOPs CANNOT be waived even for NPA Lite.**

**Cross-Border Definition:**
- Different booking locations/entities
- Execution/booking/settlement spanning multiple jurisdictions

**Why Cross-Border is Special:**
- Multiple regulatory regimes (MAS + HKMA, or FCA + MAS, etc.)
- Transfer pricing and tax implications
- Dual booking requirements
- Different legal documentation standards
- Regulatory arbitrage concerns

---

### 6.3 NPA Kick-Off Meeting

**Proposing unit organizes kick-off meeting with sign-off parties:**
- Present product overview (features, structure, target customers)
- Discuss risks and issues
- Agree on timeline for due diligence and sign-off
- Clarify sign-off party requirements

---

## 7. Maker-Checker Model & Review Process [R25, R26]

### 7.1 The Sequential Approval Chain

**NPA approval follows a strict sequential model:**

```
MAKER (Proposing Unit Lead)
  → Writes NPA, fills all sections, gathers documentation
  ↓
CHECKER (PU NPA Champion or designated reviewer)
  → Reviews for completeness, accuracy, consistency
  → Can: APPROVE, REJECT, or REQUEST CHANGES
  → If REJECT → Loop-back to Maker (+3-5 days per iteration)
  ↓
SIGN-OFF PARTIES (SOPs) — in PARALLEL
  → Each SOP assesses risk in their domain
  → Can: APPROVE, APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS, REJECT
  ↓
COO FINAL APPROVAL
  → Group BU/SU COO gives final approval to launch
```

**State Machine [R25-R26]:**
DRAFT → PENDING_CHECKER → PENDING_SIGN_OFFS → PENDING_FINAL_APPROVAL → APPROVED

---

### 7.2 Sign-Off Party Responsibilities

**Sign-off parties must:**
1. Review NPA comprehensively (product, risks, mitigants)
2. Assess if product aligns with risk appetite
3. Identify conditions (if any) to impose [R23, R24]
4. Provide timely sign-off (within SLA, default 48 hours) [R37]
5. Engage in loop-back discussions if clarifications needed

**SOPs can set three types of conditions [R23]:**
- **Permanent restrictions** — incorporated into product features
- **Product parameters** — scope of permissible activity (e.g., specific client segment only)
- **Post-launch conditions** — short-term, measurable, to be addressed after launch

---

### 7.3 NPA Champion Roles

**Proposing Unit NPA Champion:**
- Appointed by proposing unit (or GFM COO for GFM products)
- Manage end-to-end risk due diligence
- Ensure alignment with NPA requirements

**Sign-Off Party NPA Champion:**
- Appointed by sign-off party
- Facilitate timely review and sign-off within their unit

---

## 8. Sign-Off Parties (SOPs) — The Seven Assessors [R19-R24]

### 8.1 The Seven Core Sign-Off Parties

| SOP | What They Assess | Key Concerns |
|-----|-----------------|--------------|
| **RMG-Credit** | Credit risk, counterparty risk, country risk, concentration risk | Counterparty rating? Collateral? Pre-settlement exposure (PCE)? SACCR? |
| **Finance (GPC)** | Accounting treatment, P&L recognition, capital impact, ROAE | Trading or banking book? Capital consumption? Tax implications? |
| **Legal & Compliance** | Regulatory compliance, legal documentation, sanctions, financial crime | Permitted? License needed? ISDA/GMRA in place? AML/CFT? |
| **RMG-MLR** | Market risk, VaR, stress testing, liquidity risk, LCR/NSFR | IR/FX/EQ Delta/Vega? CS01? Can we hedge? Stress scenarios? HQLA? |
| **Operations (GFMO)** | Operating model, booking process, settlement, manual processes | Systems handle it? STP or manual? Settlement straight-through? |
| **Technology** | System configuration, UAT, booking systems (Murex/Mini/FA) | Murex support? New build needed? UAT plan and timeline? |
| **RMG-OR** | Overall operational risk, process risk, audit oversight | **Consultative role.** Owns NPA Standard. Reviews for completeness. |

---

### 8.2 Dynamic SOP Assignment by Track [R19]

| Track | Required SOPs |
|-------|---------------|
| Full NPA (NTG) | ALL 7 SOPs [R20] |
| Full NPA (Non-NTG) | ALL 7 SOPs [R20] |
| NPA Lite | Reduced set (typically 2-3 based on risk areas) |
| Bundling | Bundling Arbitration Team (6 members) |
| Evergreen | None (auto-approved, log-only) |
| **Cross-Border Override [R07]** | **+5 mandatory: Finance, Credit, MLR, Tech, Ops — CANNOT be waived** |

---

### 8.3 Sign-Off Authority Levels [R22]

| Scenario | Sign-Off Level |
|----------|---------------|
| NTG from overseas | **Head Office** function sign-offs required |
| Non-NTG in core markets | Location-level sign-off party (appointed by Group SU Head) |
| Non-NTG in international centres | Location or Head Office (Group SU Head's discretion) |

---

## 9. Approval Authority

### 9.1 Final Approval

**Final Approval:**
- **Group BU/SU Chief Operating Officer (COO)**
- **OR** COO's delegate (must be at least VP level)
- **OR** Party appointed by Group Head of proposing unit

**Overseas Locations:**
- Local approval MUST be obtained per local regulations
- THEN obtain Group BU/SU COO approval
- **Local approval FIRST, Group approval SECOND**

---

### 9.2 GFM-Specific Approval

**For GFM products:**
- **GFM COO** is approving authority
- GFM COO consults **GFM NPA Governance Forum** for:
  - Product classification decision
  - Appropriate NPA type (Full NPA vs NPA Lite)
  - Relevant sign-off parties selection
  - Final approval for new product

---

## 10. Cross-Border Booking — The Mandatory Override [R07]

### 10.1 What Constitutes Cross-Border

- Singapore desk trades with Hong Kong entity
- London desk books deal in Singapore books
- Any product where execution/booking/settlement spans multiple jurisdictions

---

### 10.2 Why It's Treated Specially

Cross-border introduces:
- Multiple regulatory regimes (MAS + HKMA, or FCA + MAS, etc.)
- Transfer pricing and tax implications
- Dual booking requirements
- Different legal documentation standards
- Potential for regulatory arbitrage concerns

---

### 10.3 The Override Rule (Standard Section 2.3.2) [R07]

**"For NPA/NPA Lite which involves cross border booking, the relevant sign-off parties MUST include Finance, RMG-Credit, RMG-Market & Liquidity Risk (MLR), Technology and Operations."**

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Even if the product qualifies for NPA Lite, these 5 sign-offs are mandatory and CANNOT be waived.

---

## 11. Bundling — 8-Condition Gate [R08, R17]

### 11.1 The Concept

A **bundle** is a combination of two or more individually approved products ("building blocks") packaged into a single structure for the client. The legal confirmation to the client is one document, but internally it may be booked as multiple separate deals.

**Example:** Dual Currency Deposit = FX Option (Block 1) + Fixed Deposit (Block 2)

---

### 11.2 The 8 Bundling Conditions (ALL Must Pass) [R08]

| # | Condition |
|---|-----------|
| 1 | Building blocks can be booked in Murex/Mini/FA with no new model required |
| 2 | No proxy booking in the transaction |
| 3 | No leverage in the transaction |
| 4 | No collaterals involved (or can be reviewed but not auto-rejection) |
| 5 | No third parties involved |
| 6 | Compliance considerations in each block complied with (PDD form submitted) |
| 7 | No SCF (Structured Credit Financing) except structured warrant bundle |
| 8 | Bundle facilitates correct cashflow settlement |

**If ALL 8 pass** → Bundling Approval (via Arbitration Team)
**If ANY fail** → Must go through Full NPA or NPA Lite instead [R17]

---

### 11.3 The Bundling Arbitration Team

| Member | Role |
|--------|------|
| Head of GFM COO Office NPA Team | Chair |
| RMG-MLR | Market & Liquidity Risk assessment |
| TCRM | Technology & Credit Risk Management |
| Finance-GPC | Group Product Control |
| GFMO | GFM Operations |
| GFM Legal & Compliance | Legal/regulatory assessment |

---

### 11.4 Pre-Approved (Evergreen) Bundles — No Approval Needed

Certain standard bundles are pre-approved:
- **Dual Currency Deposit/Notes** (FX Option + LNBR/Deposit/Bond)
- **Treasury Investment Asset Swap** (Bond + IRS)
- **Equity-Linked Note** (Equity Option + LNBR)

---

### 11.5 Approved FX Derivative Bundles

28+ pre-approved FX bundles exist, including:
- Best/Worst of Option, KIKO (Knock-In Knock-Out) CLI
- Boosted KO Forward with Guarantee, Multi-period EKI Strangle
- Pivot Forward, Trigger Forward, Range Coupon CCY Linked SIP

Full list maintained in "List of approved FX Bundled products.xlsx" by GFM COO Office.

---

## 12. Regulatory Clearance & UAT

### 12.1 Separate Processes

**NPA process is SEPARATE from regulatory clearance and UAT:**
- Can proceed **in parallel** (simultaneously)
- NPA sign-offs NOT conditional on regulatory clearance/UAT
- BUT: Launch CANNOT occur until BOTH complete

---

### 12.2 Issue Resolution

**Proposing unit MUST ensure:**
- All issues/conditions from regulatory clearance addressed BEFORE launch
- All issues/conditions from UAT addressed BEFORE launch
- Re-approvals obtained if material changes required based on regulatory/UAT feedback

---

## 13. Launch & Validity Period [R27, R28, R29]

### 13.1 Validity Period [R27]

| Product Type | Validity |
|-------------|----------|
| Full NPA / NPA Lite | **1 year** from approval date |
| Evergreen | **3 years** from approval date (GFM deviation) |

**If not launched within validity period:**
- NPA expires, product CANNOT be traded
- To reactivate → Engage Group BU/SU COO [R29]
- No variations → NPA Lite - Reactivation track
- Variations → Full NPA (treated as new)

---

### 13.2 Extension Rules (One-Time Only) [R28]

**ONE extension allowed:** +6 months (total maximum: 18 months)

**Extension Conditions (ALL must be met):**
1. No variation to product features
2. No alteration to risk profile (customer or bank)
3. No change to operating model or basis of sign-off
4. **Unanimous consensus** from ALL original sign-off parties
5. **Group BU/SU COO approval**

**If ANY SOP disagrees → extension denied.**

**Extension Process:**
```
Step 1: Proposing unit requests extension (BEFORE validity expires)
Step 2: Request sent to ALL original sign-off parties
Step 3: ALL must consent (unanimous)
Step 4: Group BU/SU COO reviews and approves
Step 5: Validity extended by +6 months
```

---

### 13.3 Launch Definition

**"Launch" means either:**
- The date the product is first marketed AND resulted in a sale/offer, OR
- The first trade date

**NOT Launch:** Merely indicating DBS interest to customer (not yet launched)

---

---

## 14. Post-Implementation Review (PIR) [R30, R31, R32]

### 14.1 PIR Mandatory Triggers

**PIR is MANDATORY for:**

| Trigger | Description | Sign-Off By |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Trigger 1** [R30] | ALL New-to-Group (NTG) products — even without conditions | ALL original SOPs |
| **Trigger 2** [R31] | ALL products with post-launch conditions imposed by SOPs | SOPs who imposed conditions |
| **Trigger 3** [R32] | **GFM STRICTER RULE: ALL launched products** regardless of classification | Relevant SOPs |
| **Trigger 4** | Reactivated expired NTG (no changes) — treated as extension of original | Original NPA SOPs |
| **Trigger 5** | New to location/entity referencing NTG where PIR not yet completed | As per original NTG |

**Timeline:** Must be **initiated within 6 months** of product launch

---

### 14.2 PIR Reminder Schedule

| Timing | Reminder |
|--------|---------|
| Launch + 120 days | "PIR due in 60 days, begin preparation" |
| Launch + 150 days | "PIR due in 30 days, submit draft" |
| Launch + 173 days | **"PIR OVERDUE, submit immediately"** |

---

### 14.3 PIR Exemptions

**PIR NOT required for:**
1. Non-NTG Full NPA with NO conditions imposed
2. NPA Lite with NO conditions imposed (exception: if original product was NTG → PIR still required)

---

### 14.4 PIR Content Requirements

**PIR report must include:**

**Section 1: Actual vs Projected Performance**
- Trading volume, revenue, customer uptake (projected vs actual)

**Section 2: Post-Launch Issues**
- Operational issues, system issues, customer complaints, regulatory findings
- How resolved: Actions taken

**Section 3: Conditions Compliance**
- List ALL conditions, status of each (satisfied/not), evidence

**Section 4: Lessons Learned**
- What went well, what to change, recommendations

**Section 5: Risk Assessment Update**
- New risks identified post-launch, mitigants that didn't work, updated risk profile

---

### 14.5 PIR Repeat Logic

**If SOPs identify issues during PIR:**
- PIR must be **repeated**
- New PIR scheduled: **90 days after failed PIR**
- Process continues until SOPs are satisfied

---

### 14.6 Group Audit Review

**Group Audit will:**
- Include new products in audit risk assessment
- Conduct PIR(s) where necessary (independent audit)
- Validate proposing unit's PIR findings

---

## 15. Loop-Backs, Rework & Circuit Breaker [R35, R36]

### 15.1 The Four Types of Loop-Back [R36]

**Type 1: Checker Rejection (Major Loop-Back)**
- Maker submits → Checker reviews → REJECTS
- Loop-back to Maker (Draft stage)
- **Impact:** +3-5 days per iteration
- **Current average:** 1.4 iterations per NPA

**Type 2: Approval Clarification (Smart Loop-Back)**
- SOP reviews → needs clarification
- If clarification requires NPA document changes → loop-back to Maker
- If clarification answerable from existing docs → direct response (no loop-back)
- **Time saved by smart routing:** ~2-3 days per clarification

**Type 3: Launch Preparation Issues**
- During system config/UAT → issue discovered → needs SOP re-review
- Loop-back to specific SOP only (not all)
- Typical causes: system compatibility, regulatory changes, risk threshold breaches

**Type 4: Post-Launch Corrective Action**
- After launch → PIR identifies issue → requires NPA amendment
- Loop-back to Review Stage (expedited re-approval)
- Causes: volume below projections, unexpected issues, customer feedback, regulatory findings

---

### 15.2 The Circuit Breaker Rule [R35]

**Trigger:** After **3 loop-backs** on the same NPA

**Action:** AUTOMATIC escalation to:
- Group BU/SU COO
- NPA Governance Forum

**Rationale:** 3 loop-backs indicate a fundamental problem — unclear requirements, complex edge case, or process breakdown that needs senior intervention.

**Current Metrics:**
- Loop-backs per month: **8**
- Average rework iterations: **1.4**
- Circuit breaker escalations: **~1 per month**

---

## 16. Notional Threshold Escalation [R40, R41, R42]

**Notional value of the product triggers additional requirements:**

| Notional Value | Additional Requirement | Sign-Off Impact |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| > $20M [R40] | ROAE sensitivity analysis **REQUIRED** | Upload to ROAE Appendix |
| > $50M [R41] | Finance VP review **REQUIRED** | Auto-add Finance VP to sign-off matrix |
| > $100M [R42] | CFO review **REQUIRED** | Auto-add CFO to sign-off matrix |

**These thresholds apply to ALL tracks** including Bundling (aggregate notional) and Evergreen.

**ENFORCEMENT:** System automatically adds escalation approvers when notional exceeds threshold. Cannot bypass.

---

## 18. Escalation Procedures

### 18.1 Escalation Trigger 1: Unauthorized Product Launch

**Scenario:** Product launched WITHOUT NPA process

**Action:**
1. Initiating unit: Start NPA process **without delay**
2. Escalate to: Group BU/SU COO + RMG-OR
3. Document incident (when launched, why NPA skipped, impact)
4. Complete NPA retroactively
5. Implement controls to prevent recurrence

---

### 18.2 Escalation Trigger 2: Unresolved/Contentious Issues
